Description:
   Defines classes which together embody the capabilities expected of
conformant readers and writers of the JP2 file format.  The `jp2_source'
and `jp2_target' classes define objects which derive from the abstract
compressed I/O base classes `kdu_compressed_source' and
`kdu_compressed_target'. These may be used to construct `kdu_codestream'
objects for generating or decompressing the embedded JPEG2000 code-stream box.
Methods are also provided to describe, interpret and process the
code-stream image samples in a conformant manner.
   The definitions provided here are also used to build services for the
JPX and MJ2 file formats.  Specific extensions for these file formats are
defined in "jpx.h" and "mj2.h".

     [SYNOPSIS]
       This object manages interaction with any data source conforming to
       the JP2 family file format.  To interact with such a source, you first
       call one of the overloaded `jp2_family_src::open' functions, depending
       on where the data is coming from (file, other compressed source, or
       dynamic cache).  You then pass a pointer to the `jp2_family_src' object
       into `jp2_input_box' or any of the higher level objects designed
       to manage JP2-family sources, including `jp2_source' and `mj2_source'.
       [//]
       Importantly, you can have multiple portals to boxes in a single
       `jp2_family_src' object.  Thus, you can pass the `jp2_family_src' object
       into `jp2_source::open' to gain access to JP2 header information and
       the first contiguous code-stream box, but you can concurrently open
       boxes within the source directly by passing the same object into
       another `jp2_input_box' object.  This allows you to walk through
       boxes in the source, recursing into sub-boxes as desired.  In this way,
       you can open additional code-streams (if any), examine IPR, UUID, or
       XML boxes, etc.
       [//]
       Note that you should not directly assign a `jp2_family_src' object to
       another, since it is not an interface.

           within the file can save a lot of memory when working
           with large images, but this may come at the expense of some loss
           in speed if we know ahead of time that we want to decompress
           the entire image(s).  Perhaps more significantly, if the source
           is not seekable, you will only be able to open boxes one at a time,

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Opens the box to read from the `src' object.  If `src' was opened
           using a seekable file, seekable compressed data source, or a
           dynamic cache (`kdu_cache') object, multiple boxes may be
           simultaneously opened using the same `jp2_family_src' object.
           Moreover, they may be read in any order, or in interleaved fashion.
           The internal machinery maintains information about the current read
           state and manages all required context switching, but for
           multi-threaded applications you should consider supplying
           implementing the synchronization funcions,
           `jp2_family_src::acquire_lock' and `jp2_family_src::release_lock' in
           a class derived from `jp2_family_src'.
           [//]
           Every open box has a unique `locator' value.  If you have visited
           a box before (e.g., during an initial pass through the file), you
           may open the box again using the locator you found at that time
           by invoking `jp2_input_box::get_locator'.  Using a locator, you
           may open any box using this function, not just top level boxes.
           You may think of the `locator' as the address of the box within
           its file, even though the information source might be a
           `kdu_cache' object which has no linear file structure.  Even
           in this case, a mechanism is provided (behind the scenes) for
           maintaining the association between each JP2 box and a location
           in an original file.  These locations are managed by the
           `jp2_locator::get_file_pos' and `jp2_locator::set_file_pos'
           functions.
           [//]
           An error may be generated through `kdu_error' if a fundamental
           problem is detected.  If the `jp2_family_src' object is using a
           cache as its data source, however, it is possible that the cache
           may not yet have sufficient information to open the box.  In this
           case, the function returns false, leaving the box closed (`exists'
           remains false).  Any of the following conditions may cause this
           to happen:
           [>>] All or part of the box's header might not yet have been
                loaded into the cache.
           [>>] The cache might not contain sufficient information to
                determine the cache data-bin to which the box belongs.  This
                may happen if the supplied `locator' object identifies only 
                an original file location (set using
                `jp2_locator::set_file_pos'), in which case it may be
                necessary to walk through multiple data-bins to determine
                where the dynamic representation of that box will be; and
                some of the intermediate bins might not yet be available.
           [>>] The box might be represented by a placeholder box, whose
                contents are not yet fully available -- the placeholder
                box's contents must be read before the actual location of
                the box's contents can be determined.
           [//]
           If any of the above occurs, the function returns false with the box
           still closed.  Trying again later, however, once the cache contents
           have been augmented, may result in success (`exists' becomes true).
         [RETURNS]
           True if a new box was opened, else false.
         [ARG: src]
           Must point to an open `jp2_family_src' object, which must not be
           closed until after the present object is closed (or destroyed).
         [ARG: locator]
           To open the very first box in the JP2 source, you may supply the
           empty (or null) locator, which is created by the `jp2_locator'
           object's constructor.  Other values for this argument may be
           obtained by invoking `get_locator' on this or another
           `jp2_input_box' object, or by using `jp2_locator::set_file_pos'.
           The same box (or sub-box) may be opened as often as desired, by
           different `jp2_input_box' objects if you like, simply by passing
           the relevant locator to this function.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT virtual bool

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Opens the box as a sub-box of the indicated `super_box'.  You
           may think of the present box and the super-box as sharing a common
           "read pointer" so that once the present box is closed, reading
           may continue within the super-box from the point where we left off.
           The super-box is "locked" so long as any sub-box is open; an
           error will be generated if any attempt is made to read from a
           super-box which is locked in this way.  While the sub-box is being
           read, values returned by `super_box->get_remaining_bytes' or
           `super_box->get_pos' are unstable and cannot be trusted.
           [//]
           If this function fails to open a new box, the function returns
           false, leaving the box closed (the `exists' function will return
           false).  This may happen if one of the following conditions occur:
           [>>] The super-box is exhausted, meaning that it has no remaining
                content bytes at all; or
           [>>] The super-box contains insufficient contents for the moment
                to open a new box, but it may contain sufficient bytes in
                the future as more data becomes available.  This is only
                possible if the `jp2_family_src' object uses a cache for its
                information source, since the cache may be updated
                dynamically.  This case may be distinguished from the
                former case by checking the super-box's `get_remaining_bytes'
                member, which will be 0 if and only if the super-box has
                actually been exhausted.

           sub-box of another `jp2_input_box' object, the function attempts
           to open a new sibling sub-box, failing (leaving the box in the

           in sequence, failing (leaving the box in the closed state and
           returning false) only if the source is exhausted.  Note
           that the behaviour could be misleading in this case, if the

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT virtual bool load_in_memory(int max_bytes);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function attempts to load the entire contents of the box
           into an internal dynamically allocated block of memory.  If
           successful, the `get_capabilities' function will report the
           following capability flags: `KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEQUENTIAL',
           `KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEEKABLE' and `KDU_SOURCE_CAP_IN_MEMORY'.
           Moreover, the `access_memory' function can then be used to
           directly access the memory block, as an alternative to using
           the `seek' and `read' functions.
           [//]
           The function may fail if, for example, the ultimate source of
           information is a `kdu_compressed_source' object which does not
           offer `KDU_SOURCE_CAP_SEQUENTIAL'.  While the conditions under
           which the source cannot be loaded directly into an internal block
           of memory may be rather technical, you need not worry about the
           details.  If the function succeeds, it will return true; otherwise
           it returns false and you must use access the box contents via
           the `read' function.
           [//]
           If the function succeeds, the internal memory block spans the
           extent of the box contents, but does not include its header.  It
           is deleted when the box is closed (or destroyed).
           [//]
           You may, if you like, call this function after the box has
           already been read, in whole or in part, so long as it has not
           yet been closed.  In this case, however, the function is not
           likely to return true unless the source is seekable.
         [RETURNS]
           True if and only if a memory block was allocated and loaded with
           the box contents (either by this function, or else by a previous
           call to this function in the present box or a super-box).
           Whether or not the function returns true, you can always seek
           within the box and read its contents using the `seek' and `read'
           functions.  However, only in the case that the function returns
           true can you directly access the loaded box contents via the
           `access_memory' function.
           [//]
           In the special case where the ultimate data source terminates
           prematurely, prior to the nominal end of the box, the present
           function will still allocate a memory block and return true
           (assuming that this is what it would have done if the data source
           did not terminate prematurely).  However, the internal length
           of the box will be adjusted to reflect the amount of data which is
           actually available.  If your application needs to know whether
           or not premature termination has occurred, you can call the
           `get_box_bytes' function before and after the present function,
           comparing the two results.
         [ARG: max_bytes]
           Specifies a limit on the size of the memory block that you are
           prepared to allocate in order for this function to succeed.  If
           the length of the box contents exceeds this value, the function
           returns false without allocating any memory.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Initializes the internal object, specifying the dimensions occupied
           by the image on the canvas and the number of image components.
           It is illegal to call this function unless there is an internal
           object (`exists' must return true) and that object has not yet
           been initialized.  To complete the initialization, precision
           information must be supplied for each image component (see below).
           [//]
           It is often more convenient to perform the configuration with a
           single call to the second form of this overloaded function, which
           uses the code-stream's `siz_params' object to recover the relevant
           information.
           [//]
           While the `init' function provides all information required to
           write the JP2 image header box, it does not provide enough
           information to determine the codestream profile or whether or
           not it uses specific Part-2 extensions.  This information is
           required to reliably determine compatibility information for
           JPX files and whether or not the codestream can be legally
           embedded within a JP2 or MJ2 file.  For this reason, you are
           strongly encouraged to call the `finalize_compatibility'
           function at an appropriate point.
         [ARG: size]
           Holds the height and width of the image region on the canvas.
           Specifically, these are exactly the dimensions returned by
           `kdu_codestream::get_dims' when invoked with a negative `comp_idx'
           argument.  Note, however, that the `kdu_codestream::get_dims'
           function also identifies the location of the image region on the
           canvas -- an important property which is not recorded here.
           The limited dimensional information recoverable from the JP2
           "Image Header" box is almost entirely useless, since it cannot be
           mapped to image component dimensions without considering
           sub-sampling factors and the precise location of the image region
           on the canvas.  It may be useful in establishing the size of a
           scanned page when used in conjunction with explicit capture
           resolution information.  It may also be useful for describing
           images which are not compressed at all (i.e., if `compression_type' 
           is `JP2_COMPRESSION_TYPE_NONE').
         [ARG: num_components]
           Number of image components.  Although there will often be one
           image component for each colour channel, the number of image
           components can be either smaller than (see `jp2_palette') or
           larger than (if some components are not used to represent colour
           channels) the number of colour channels.
         [ARG: unknown_space]
           True if the colour space information accessed via a
           `jp2_colour' object which uses this code-stream is not known to
           be correct.  This is often the case in practice, where an sRGB
           space is often assumed in the absence of any specific knowledge
           concerning the primaries or gamma correction.  It is not all that
           clear why this attribute is included in the "Image Header" box,
           but so be-it.
         [ARG: compression_type]
           For JPEG2000 code-streams, use `JP2_COMPRESSION_TYPE_JPEG2000'.
           For a description of other values, see the description of the
           `get_compression_type' function.

           Image Header Box.  However, it provides important information to
           allow the correct generation of File Type and Reader Requirements
           boxes for a JPX file and also to determine the legality of JP2
           and MJ2 files.  These processes require knowledge of the
           profile and/or specific Part-2 extensions used by the associated
           codestream.  This information, in turn, requires access to the
           finalized parameter attributes associated with the codestream's
           main header.  Since this information might not be available when
           the `jp2_dimensions' object is first initialized, this separate
           function allows the information to be acquired later.
           [//]
           When writing a JP2/MJ2/JPX file, this function should be called
           with the root of the parameter sub-system returned by
           `kdu_codestream::access_siz', after the `kdu_params::finalize_all'
           function has been used to finalize all main header attributes,
           at least.  It should be called before the relevant file header
           is written.  If you do not call this function, the generated
           file might be written with misleading File Type and/or
           Reader Requirements boxes.
           [//]
           When reading a JP2/MJ2/JPX file, there is no need to ever call
           this function, unless you are going to use the present object
           to initialize another `jp2_dimensions' object using the
           `copy' member function.  In this case, you should call the
           present function prior to `copy' if you wish to include the copied
           dimensional information in a JP2/MJ2/JPX file with correctly
           generated File Type and Reader Requirements boxes.
           [//]
           If the codestream associated with this object is not a JPEG2000
           codestream, you will not be calling this function.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use in place of the first form of the `finalize_compatibility'
           function if you explicitly know the compatibility information.
           Pay close attention to the definitions of `is_part1' and
           `is_baseline' given below, or else let the first form of the
           function figure them out for you.  The present function presents
           a useful alternative if you wish to write header information
           before actually creating a `kdu_codestream' object and configuring
           it with the coding parameters that the first form of the function
           uses to figure out compatibility information.
         [ARG: profile]
           Set this argument to the value reported by the `siz_params' object's
           `Sprofile' attribute in the relevant codestream.
         [ARG: is_jpx_baseline]
           This argument is relevant only if `profile' is `Sprofile_PART2',
           meaning that Part-2 codestream features are being used.  In that
           case, this argument indicates whether the collection of Part-2
           codestream features used is compatible with the definition of
           "JPX baseline".  Specifically, for JPX baseline compatibility, at
           most the `Sextensions_MCT' and/or `Sextensions_CURVE' features can
           be used (as returned by the `Sextensions' attribute of
           `siz_params').  Moreover, the only allowable MCT (multi-component
           transform) extensions are those which involve a single transform
           stage, containing a single transform block (component-collection),
           which implements an irreversible matrix transform.

       [//]
       The principle intent of palettes is to facilitate the efficient
       representation of images with very few distinct colours, where a
       single image component provides indices into the palette.  However,
       a JP2 palette is really just a collection of lookup tables, with
       the restriction that all lookup tables have the same number of
       entries.  It is legal to apply any of the lookup tables to any
       of the code-stream image components in order to create new mapped
       channel values.  Any or all of these mapped channels may then be
       associated with particular colour reproduction functions.
       These associations are described by the JP2 "Component Mapping" and
       "Channel Definition" boxes (possibly with the help of a "Codestream
       Registration" box), whose information is collectively accessed and
       manipulated via the `jp2_channels' interface.

           +2^{KDU_FIX_POINT-1}.  The normalization is such
           that the lower bound here corresponds to an actual LUT value of
           -2^{B-1} and the upper bound corresponds to an actual LUT
           value of +2^{B-1}, where B is the bit-depth returned by

class jp2_channels {
  /* [BIND: interface]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       Provides a uniform, simplified interface to the information
       associated with the JP2 "Component Mapping" and "Channel Definition"
       boxes, the JPX "Opacity" box and, to a limited extent, the JPX
       "Codestream Registration" box, as well as implementing the default
       bindings which apply where one or more of these boxes is missing.
       Together, this information serves to identify the relationship between
       each "colour" reproduction channel of a JP2 image (or a JPX compositing
       layer) and the underlying code-stream image components which generate
       it.
       [//]
       Reproduction channels may be grouped into the following three
       categories:
       [>>] Colour intensity channels, the number of which depends
            upon the colour space: 1 for monochrome; 3 for RGB and related
            colour spaces; 4 for CMYK; etc.
       [>>] Opacity channels, often called alpha channels.  A separate
            opacity channel may be defined for each colour intensity channel,
            although they will often all be the same.
       [>>] Pre-multiplied opacity channels (sometimes called pre-multiplied
            alpha).  Again, each colour intensity channel may have its own
            distinct pre-multiplied opacity channels.
       [//]
       The actual interpretation of the colour intensity channels in terms of
       a specific colour space is provided by "Colour Specification" boxes,
       whose contents are managed by the `jp2_colour' interface.
       [//]
       Objects of this class are merely interfaces to an internal
       object, which cannot be directly created by an application.
       Creation and destruction of the internal object, as well as saving
       and reading of the associated JP2 boxes are capabilities reserved
       for the internal machinery associated with the file format manager
       which provides the interface.
       [//]
       Objects which can provide a non-empty `jp2_channels' interface
       include `jp2_source', `jp2_target', `jpx_layer_source',
       `jpx_layer_target', `mj2_video_source' and `mj2_video_target'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is used, together with `set_opacity_mapping' and
           `set_premult_mapping', to establish the relationship, if any,
           between code-stream image components and the reproduction
           functions of colour intensity, opacity and pre-multiplied opacity.
           The present function is most important, establishing the source
           of colour intensity information.
           [//]
           Each colour's intensity may be directly assigned to some
           code-stream image component.  Alternatively, it may be associated
           with the output of a palette lookup table (LUT), together with a
           code-stream image component which provides indices into the LUT.
           [//]
           The `colour_idx' argument identifies the particular intensity
           channel whose mapping is being defined.  A complete `jp2_channels'
           object must have an intensity mapping for each colour channel.
           However, the `init' function automatically installs a default
           mapping which directly associates the first `num_colours'
           code-stream components of code-stream 0 with the `num_colours'
           intensity channels.  If this is what you want, there is no need
           to explicitly call the present function.
         [ARG: colour_idx]
           The meaning of this argument depends upon the colour space.  Some
           common examples are:
           [>>] For monochrome (greyscale) imagery, the only legal value is 0.
           [>>] For RGB spaces, a colour index of 0 means red, 1 means green
                and 2 mean blue.
           [>>] For CMYK, 0 means cyan, 1 means magenta, 2 means yellow and
                3 means black.
         [ARG: codestream_component]
           Identifies the image component (starting from 0) of the
           code-stream identified by `codestream_idx' which is used to
           create the relevant colour intensity channel, either by direct
           assignment or after mapping through a palette LUT.
         [ARG: lut_idx]
           Set to -1 (the default) if the code-stream image component is to
           be assigned directly to the relevant colour intensity channel.
           Otherwise, the code-stream component samples are indices to a
           lookup table, where `lut_idx' gives the index of the lookup
           table (starting from 0), as it appears in the `jp2_palette'
           object.
         [ARG: codestream_idx]
           Index of the code-stream whose components and palette lookup
           tables (if required) are used to generate this colour intensity
           channel.  The meaning of the index for various file formats is
           as follows:
           [>>] For JP2 files, there is only one code-stream
                which can be interpreted by the file reader and it must have
                index 0.
           [>>] For JPX files, index 0 refers to the first code-stream
                (first contiguous code-stream or fragment table) and the
                first code-stream header box (if any) in the file.  Subsequent
                code-stream / code-stream header box pairs are identified by
                consecutive integers.  Note that the same code-stream may
                be used to define intensity channels in different JPX
                compositing layers.
           [>>] For MJ2 files, all code-streams must have the same
                reproduction rules and the index used here must be 0.

      set_chroma_key(int colour_idx, kdu_int32 key_val);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           You may use this function to specify a chroma key.  Any pixel whose
           colour matches the chroma key exactly is understood to be fully
           transparent.  Note carefully that many potential dangers exist
           with chroma keys.  The main danger is that JPEG2000 code-streams
           are usually designed with lossy decoding in mind.  Even if the
           original image is represented losslessly, truly lossless decoding
           may not be possible during interactive remote image browsing, until
           all data has been received from a server.  Also, it is perfectly
           acceptable for a compliant decoder to discard some of the originally
           encoded data, resulting in a lossy rendition.  Furthermore,
           reconstruction at reduced resolutions is a desirable capability
           for general purpose decoders, which generally prevents reliable
           recovery of chroma keys.  Finally, unless the reversible processing
           path has been used, uncertainties on the order of a few digital
           counts typically arise as a result of numerical implementation
           differences between different compliant decoders.
           [//]
           For all of the above reasons, applications should be strongly
           discouraged from using this function.  If it is used, the
           information must be recorded in a JPX "Opacity" (opct) box, which
           places restrictions on other component mapping possibilities.
           One immediate restriction is that you may not define opacity or
           pre-multiplied opacity channels in addition to the chroma key.
           If a chroma key value is defined for any one colour intensity
           channel, a chroma key value must be defined for all `num_colours'
           colour intensity channels, where `num_colours' is the value
           supplied to `init'.
         [ARG: colour_idx]
           Identifies the colour intensity channel whose chroma key is
           being supplied.  The meaning of this argument is
           identical to that explained in connection with the
           `set_colour_mapping' function.
         [ARG: key_val]
           Defines the chroma key value.  If the colour intensity channel
           is derived directly from an image component, the bit-depth and
           signed/unsigned properties of the chroma key value are those
           of the corresponding image component.  If the colour intensity
           channel is derived from a palette LUT, the bit-depth and
           signed/unsigned properties of the chroma key value are those of
           the corresponding palette lookup table (see `jp2_palette').

           `get_opacity_mapping', to determine the relationship, if any,
           between code-stream image components and the reproduction
           functions of colour intensity, opacity and pre-multiplied opacity.
           The present function identifies the source of pre-multiplied
           opacity information, if any, for each colour.
           [//]
           Each colour's pre-multiplied opacity may be directly assigned to
           some code-stream component.  Alternatively, it may be associated
           with the output of a palette lookup table (LUT), together with a
           code-stream image component which provides indices into the LUT.
         [RETURNS]
           True if a mapping is available for the relevant pre-multiplied
           opacity channel.
         [ARG: colour_idx]
           See the `set_colour_mapping' function for a description of this
           argument.
         [ARG: codestream_component]
           Used to retrieve the code-stream image component (starting from 0)
           which is used to create the relevant pre-multiplied opacity channel,
           either by direct assignment or after mapping through a palette LUT.
         [ARG: lut_idx]
           Set to -1 (the default) if the code-stream image component is
           assigned directly to the pre-multiplied opacity channel.
           Otherwise, the code-stream component samples are indices to a
           lookup table, where `lut_idx' gives the index of the lookup
           table (starting from 0), as it appears in the `jp2_palette'
           object.
         [ARG: codestream_idx]
           Used to retrieve the index of the code-stream whose components
           and palette lookup tables (if required) are used to generate the
           identified pre-multiplied opacity channel.  See the discussion which
           accompanies the `set_colour_mapping' function for more details
           on the meaning of this index in different file formats.

           appearing with the `set_chroma_key' function.

           True if the colour description includes a chroma key.  If so,
           all colour channels will have a chroma key value, and there
           will be no opacity or pre-multiplied opacity descriptions.

                pseudo-RGB coordinates.  Specifically, if C, M and Y are

                them forms R=1-C, G=1-M and B=1-Y.  The ICT (irreversible
                colour transform) defined by JPEG2000 Part 1 code-streams
                is then applied to the complemented colour channels to
                form luminance and chrominance channels.  The black (K)

                may be found in PIMA 7667; however, the extension is simple
                enough to understand:
                   (*) The underlying primaries and gamma function are the

                negative and abnormally large values for the linear R, G and
                B primary intensities are considered legal.  The gamma function
                processes negative channel values by processing their
                magnitude in the usual fashion and passing the sign across
                the gamma function -- that is, the gamma function is defined
                to be and odd (symmetric) function of its input.
                   (*) Regarding the gamma corrected channel intensities as
                unsigned quantities with a nominal range of 0 to 1 (remember
                that negative and abnormally large values are allowed, though),
                these values are scaled by 0.5 and then offset by adding
                exactly 0.375.

                       (0.3127,0.3290), and gamma=1/0.45, with beta=0.099.
                   (*) The opponent colour transform used to map RGB to Y,

                where Y, Pb and Pr are obtained by scaling and offsetting
                Y', Pb' and Pr'.  Exactly as for the `JP2_YCbCr1_SPACE', if
                R, G and B lie in the nominal range 0 to 1, so that Y' has
                the same range and Pb' and Pr' lie in the range -0.5 to +0.5,
                the actual opponent channels are scaled such that
                Y = (219*Y'+16) / 256, Pb = Pb' * 224/256 and
                Pr = Pr' * 224/256.  This ensures that when these quantities
                are represented as unsigned 8-bit numbers, they will lie in

                coordinates.  Instead, the following procedure is used to
                obtain esYCC coordinates.
                   (*) The colour space is based on the same primaries and

                esRGB, the linear primary RGB coordinates are allowed to take
                on negative and abnormally large values.
                   (*) The opponent transform is obtained by first applying
                the ICT (irreversible colour transform) defined by JPEG2000
                Part 1 to the above-mentioned primaries, and then scaling the
                Cb and Cr coordinates by 0.5.  Once this is done, negative
                or abnormally large values for the luminance coordinate are
                clipped so that the extended gamut information is retained only
                in the chrominance channels.

           kdu_uint16 temperature=5000);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function may be used to initialize the `jp2_colour' object
           with a `JP2_CIELab_SPACE' or `JP2_CIEJab_SPACE' colour space
           description which has non-default parameters.
           [//]
           To understand the role of the various range and offset parameters
           we will start by describing CIE Lab.  The CIE equations for this
           colour space start by defining a collection of normalized
           linear primaries, X'=X/X0, Y'=Y/Y0 and Z'=Z/Z0, all in the range
           0 to 1, where X0, Y0 and Z0 are the whitepoint tri-stimulus
           responses for the relevant illuminant.  These are subjected to
           gamma correction, with a gamma value of 3.0 and beta=0.16.  Then
           L, a* and b* coordinates are formed from
           [>>] L = 100*Y' -- has a nominal range from 0 to 100;
           [>>] a* = 431*(X'-Y') -- has a nominal range from -85 to +85;
           [>>] b* = 172.4*(Y'-Z') -- has a nominal range from -75 to +125
           [//]
           To represent these quantities digitally, we define scaled and
           offset coordinates L', a' and b', each of which has a nominal range
           from 0 to 1.  To represent these quantities as n-bit numbers, we
           simply multiply by (2^n-1).  Specifically, we write
           [>>] L' = L / `Lrange'  + `Loff'/(2^`Lbits'-1)
           [>>] a' = a* / `Arange' + `Aoff'/(2^`Abits'-1)
           [>>] a' = a* / `Brange' + `Boff'/(2^`Bbits'-1)
           [//]
           In the above, `Lbits', `Abits' and `Bbits' are the actual precision,
           as reported by the `jp2_dimensions' object, which is associated with
           each of the 3 colour channels.
           [//]
           The weakness of this representation is obvious, since the offset
           terms should have been recorded as real-valued ratios, rather than
           integers whose meaning depends on the bit-depth.  The bit-depth is
           not recorded with colour descriptions, so the meaning of a colour
           description is not self contained -- a most regrettable oversight
           on the part of JPX!!
           [//]
           Unlike other JP2/JPX design weaknesses which we have been able
           to hide through the design of appropriate Kakadu interfaces, this
           one cannot safely be concealed.  We force the application to
           supply both the integer-valued offets and the bit-depths of
           each component here.  The bit-depths will be automatically
           checked against those identified by the `jp2_dimensions'
           object, after untangling the various interconnections between
           colour channels and code-stream components, and any inconsistency
           will result in an error being generated (through `kdu_error')
           when the relevant file header is being written.
           [//]
           We turn now to the Jab space.  This colour space is based on
           CIECAM97, which actually describes a colour appearance model
           rather than a colour space.  Jab is an encoding of 3 of the
           parameters from this colour appearance model, from which any
           of the other parameters may be recovered if desired.  Unfortunately,
           CIECAM97 may be subject to major revision, so it is not sure how
           stable any Jab image encoding can be expected to be.  A revised
           CIECAM97 proposal by Mark Fairchild in 2000 describes various
           choices which could be used for the a and b coordinates.  For
           these reasons, we do not commit ourselves to a more thorough
           explanation here and we do not implement an colour transforms
           based on CIEJab.
         [ARG: space]
           Must be one of `JP2_CIELab_SPACE' or `JP2_CIEJab_SPACE'.
         [ARG: Lrange]
           Range of luminance (L or J) coordinate.  Default value is 100.
         [ARG: Loff]
           Works together with `Lbits' to identify an offset for the

         [ARG: Lbits]
           Precision of the sample values used to represent the luminance
           channel.  This value must agree with the actual value returned
           by the relevant `jp2_dimensions' object's
           `jp2_dimensions::get_bit_depth' function.  The need to include
           a value here is the result of poor design in the JPX file format.
         [ARG: Arange]
           Range of the a* coordinate.  Default value is 170 for Lab and 255
           for Jab.
         [ARG: Aoff]
           Works together with `Abits' to identify an offset for the
           a* coordinate.  Default is 2^{`Abits'-1}.
         [ARG: Abits]
           Precision of the sample values used to represent the a*
           channel.  This value must agree with the actual value returned
           by the relevant `jp2_dimensions' object's
           `jp2_dimensions::get_bit_depth' function.  The need to include
           a value here is the result of poor design in the JPX file format.
         [ARG: Brange]
           Range of the b* coordinate.  Default value is 200 for Lab and
           255 for Jab.
         [ARG: Boff]
           Works together with `Bbits' to identify an offset for the
           a* coordinate.  Default is 0.75*2^{`Bbits'-1} for Lab and
           2^{`Bbits'-1} for Jab.
         [ARG: Bbits]
           Precision of the sample values used to represent the b*
           channel.  This value must agree with the actual value returned
           by the relevant `jp2_dimensions' object's
           `jp2_dimensions::get_bit_depth' function.  The need to include
           a value here is the result of poor design in the JPX file format.
         [ARG: illuminant]
           Identifies the illuminant for the `JP2_CIELab_SPACE'.  This
           argument is ignored if `space'=`JP2_CIEJab_SPACE'.  Rather than
           specifying the illuminant through its chromaticity coordinates,
           an enumeration is used.  The possible values are as follows:

           [>>] `JP2_CIE_D75' -- CIE standard daylight at 7500K
           [>>] `JP2_CIE_SA'  -- CIE standard illuminant A (tungsten)
           [>>] `JP2_CIE_SC'  -- CIE standard illuminant C (??)
           [>>] `JP2_CIE_F2'  -- CIE standard fluorescent F2
           [>>] `JP2_CIE_F7'  -- CIE standard fluorescent F7
           [>>] `JP2_CIE_F11' -- CIE standard fluorescent F11
         [ARG: temperature]
           Ignored unless `space' = `JP2_CIELab_SPACE' and
           `illuminant' = `JP2_CIE_DAY'.  Gives the colour temperature for
           a CIE standard daylight (these are all defined by three power
           spectral basis functions and an equation which converts the
           temperature to weights on these three basis functions), measured
           in degrees Kelvin.

           argument.  The internal object makes a copy of this buffer.

           The standard ICC header in this buffer identifies its length and

           [//]
           The most commonly used form of the gamma function is not
           a pure power law, but may be described by two parameters,
           gamma and beta, as explained in Chapter 1 of the book by
           Taubman and Marcellin.  For reference, the sRGB space has
           `gamma'=2.4 and `beta'=0.055, while the NTSC RGB space
           has `gamma'=2.2 and `beta'=0.099.  If `beta'=0, the gamma
           function is a pure power law and can be efficiently
           represented by the ICC profile.  Unfortunately, this
           form is not recommended, since inversion is ill conditioned
           and can substantially amplify quantization artifacts.  For
           the more general and more useful case where beta is non-zero,
           the function must be represented through tabulated values.
           These are uniformly spaced in the non-linear (gamma corrected)
           space.  The number of tabulated points may be explicitly
           controlled using the `num_points' argument.

           Same as the third form of this overloaded function, except
           that a restricted ICC profile is automatically generated to
           describe an RGB space having primaries, reference illuminant
           and gamma function given by the various parameters.
           [//]
           The reference primaries of the colour space are defined by
           x-y chromaticity coordinates (xy_red[0],xy_red[1]),
           (xy_green[0],xy_green[1]) and (xy_blue[0],xy_blue[1]).  The
           reference illuminant is either D50 or D65 (default), depending
           on the value of the `reference_is_D50' argument.  Equal quantities
           of the reference primaries produce the adapted whitepoint of
           this illuminant.
           [//]
           For a description of the `gamma' and `beta' parameters, consult
           the description found with the third form of this overloaded
           function.
         [ARG: xy_red]
           2-element array containing the red (first) channel's chromaticity
           coordinates.
         [ARG: xy_green]
           2-element array containing the green (second) channel's chromaticity
           coordinates.
         [ARG: xy_blue]
           2-element array containing the blue (third) channel's chromaticity
           coordinates.
         [ARG: gamma]
           See above.  Note that the function does not currently accept
           gamma values less than 1.
         [ARG: beta]
           See above.  Note that beta must be in the range 0 (inclusive)
           to 1 (exclusive).
         [ARG: num_points]
           Used only if `beta' != 0, in which case the gamma function must
           be described through tabulated values.
         [ARG: reference_is_D50]
           If true, the reference illuminant is D50 and equal quantities of
           the three channel values produce the adapted whitepoint for this
           illuminant.  Otherwise, the reference illuminant is D65, and equal
           quantities of the three channel values produce the adapted
           whitepoint for D65.

           and attempting to install new ones.
           [//]
           The following limitations currently exist:
           [>>] The only enumerated colour space described by the JPX
                standard which is not supported here is `JP2_CIEJab_SPACE'.
                It is unclear how stable this colour space really is, since
                major revisions to the colour appearance model in CIECAM97
                have been proposed at least once.
           [>>] Only some of the general ICC colour descriptions associated
                with the `JP2_anyICC_SPACE' colour space can be converted.
                In particular, 3D lookup tables are not supported.
         [RETURNS]
           False if the requested colour conversion operation is not supported
           by the current implementation.  Although we endeavour to support
           the vast majority of JPX-compatible colour spaces, we do not
           currently support conversion from ICC profiles which use 3D
           lookup tables, or the `JP2_CIEJab_SPACE'.  Of course, it is also
           not possible to support vendor-specific colour descriptions here.
         [ARG: use_wide_gamut]
           Set this argument to true if you would like to avoid (or minimize
           the likelihood of) gamut truncation during the application of
           non-linear tone curves.  Many colour transformations require sample
           values to be mapped through a tone curve back to a representation
           which is linear with respect to radiance, wherein linear
           transformations are performed, and the results are subsequently
           transformed again through a non-linear tone curve (typically the
           sRGB gamma curve).  The tone curves are implemented using lookup
           tables and the inputs to each lookup table are clipped to the
           nominal range of the colour samples.  In most cases, the impact
           of this clipping is negligible, but it may affect the gamut if
           the source and output colour spaces have significantly different
           gamuts.  Especially for wide gamut input colour descriptions, the
           use of a wide gamut mapping is desirable.  The current
           implementation uses lookup tables which are twice as large
           as they nominally need to be when wide gamut processing is
           requested.
         [ARG: prefer_fast_approximations]
           Set this to true if you don't care too much about exact colour
           reproduction, but speed is more important (e.g., for video
           applications).  In this case, an approximate opponent transform
           might be used, or primary transformations might be avoided where
           the source and output primary chromaticities are
           sufficiently similar.

         [ARG: line]
           Although `kdu_line_buf' objects can represent sample values in
           four different ways, the present function requires the data to
           have a 16-bit normalized (fixed point) representation, with a
           nominal dynamic range of -0.5 to 0.5 (offsets will be added and
           later removed, as necessary, to create unsigned data for
           processing by tone reproduction curves).  The least significant
           `KDU_FIX_POINT' bits of each 16-bit integer are the fraction bits
           of the fixed point representation.  The selection of this
           representation is intended to facilitate interaction with the
           sample data processing operations conducted by the objects

           four different ways, the present function requires the data to
           have a 16-bit normalized (fixed point) representation, with a
           nominal dynamic range of -0.5 to 0.5 (offsets will be added and
           later removed, as necessary, to create unsigned data for
           processing by tone reproduction curves).  The least significant
           `KDU_FIX_POINT' bits of each 16-bit integer are the fraction bits
           of the fixed point representation.  The selection of this
           representation is intended to facilitate interaction with the
           sample data processing operations conducted by the objects
           defined in "kdu_sample_processing.h" -- see, for example,
           `kdu_synthesis' or `kdu_decoder'.
         [RETURNS]
           False if conversion is not possible.  This happens only if the
           call to `init' returned false, or if `init' was never called.
         [ARG: red]
           Holds sample values for the first colour channel on input.  Upon
           return, the values are overwritten with the colour corrected red
           data of the output sRGB space.  Note that all samples have the
           signed, 16-bit fixed point representation with `KDU_FIX_POINT'
           fraction bits, as described above.
         [ARG: green]
           As for `red', but holds the second colour channel
           on input and the sRGB green samples on output.
         [ARG: blue]
           As for `red', but holds the third colour channel
           on input and the sRGB blue samples on output.
         [ARG: width]
           If negative, the function processes all samples in the line
           buffers (they must all have the same length in this case,
           as reported by `kdu_line_buf::get_width').  Otherwise, only the
           first `width' samples of each line buffer are processed and the
           buffers may have different lengths so long as each has
           sufficient samples.

  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       Provides full support for interacting with JP2 files.  You may wish
       to use the `jpx_source', since it is able to handle both JP2 files
       and the much more general JPX files in a consistent manner. Note
       that the present object has changed in two important ways since
       Kakadu v3.4.
       [>>] The JP2 source must now be opened indirectly by first opening a
            `jp2_family_src' object and then passing it to the `open' function.
            You must then call the `read_header' member to complete the
            process of opening the JP2 source, reading its header and
            preparing to read from the embedded contiguous code-stream.
       [>>] Whereas this object used to be an interface to an hidden internal
            object, so that copying the interface served simply to duplicate
            the reference to the internal object, this is no longer the case.
            Assigning one `jp2_source' object to another is now strictly
            prohibited, and you should pass only references to such objects
            around inside your application.  This is unlikely to impact
            many applications.
       [//]
       An important benefit of the changes described above is that it is
       possible to pass the same `jp2_family_src' object to multiple
       `jp2_input_box' or `jp2_input_box'-derived objects, so that the
       JP2 source can be examined in a variety of different ways.  In some
       cases, multiple code-streams may be available from a single source,
       and each of these can be opened and passed to `kdu_codestream::create'
       now.  A second benefit, is that the `read_header' method can be used
       with caching data sources whose cache entries evolve over time; it may
       be called multiple times, until sufficient information is available
       to deduce all relevant header information.

            (`jp2_dimensions', `jp2_colour', `jp2_channels', etc.) as
            appropriate.
       [>>] Call `write_header' to write the JP2 header.
       [>>] Optionally write additional boxes, opening them using the base
            object's `jp2_output_box::open_next' function, writing their
            contents (or sub-boxes) and closing them using
            `jp2_output_box::close'.
       [>>] Call `open_codestream' prior to any call to
            `kdu_codestream::flush'.
       [>>] Call the base object's `jp2_output_box::close' function.
       [>>] Optionally write additional boxes or code-streams by using
            `jp2_output_box::open_next' and/or `open_codestream', closing
            the relevant boxes once you are done with them.
       [>>] Call `jp2_family_tgt::close' when you are completely finished.
       [//]
       Note that objects of this class are no longer merely interfaces to an

       [//]
       Also note that the base object's `jp2_output_box::close' function does
       not close the file (or other target device).  It simply closes the
       currently open output box.  To close the file, you need to call
       `jp2_family_tgt::close'.

           `kdu_codestream::create' function the present object was passed.

           The `rubber_length' argument indicates whether or not you want the

           If the box has a rubber length, its length field will be set to 0
           and the box is expected to continue to the end of the file.
           Otherwise, the box's contents must be buffered internally, which
           might take a lot of memory, so setting `rubber_length' to true
           is usually the best approach.
           [//]
           It is possible to write multiple code-streams to the file.  To
           do this, close the first code-stream (`jp2_output_box::close') and
           then call the present function a second time, and so forth.

           have a rubber length.

     [SYNOPSIS]
       Manages a list of URL's which may be referenced from within some
       JP2-family data sources (e.g. JPX and MJ2) as containers of data
       which is not actually embedded in the main file.  This information
       is recorded in at most one JPX data reference (`dtbl') box or
       MJ2 data references box (`dref').
       [//]
       Objects of this class are merely interfaces to an internal
       object, which cannot be directly created by an application.
       Creation and destruction of the internal object, as well as saving
       and reading of the associated data reference box are capabilities
       reserved for the internal machinery associated with the file format
       manager which provides the interface.
       [//]
       Objects which can provide a non-empty `jp2_data_references' interface
       include `jpx_source' and `jpx_target'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to add a new URL to the list maintained by
           the data reference object.  If `url_idx'=0, a URL index
           is assigned automatically.  In this case, if the URL is not
           unique, the returned index may refer to an existing entry.  Also,
           in this case, if `url' is NULL or holds an empty string, the URL
           is considered to refer to the file which contains the data
           references box, and so the returned index will be 0.
           [//]
           If the supplied `url_idx' argument is greater than 0, the
           function adds the URL as having this index, regardless of
           whether it is NULL, an empty string, or non-unique.  This
           may cause overwriting of an existing URL which was previously
           added with the same index.
         [ARG: url]
           If NULL, the entry refers to the current file.  Otherwise, any
           string supplied here will be recorded as-is in the relevant
           data-references box (`dtbl' or `dref'), without any attempt to
           verify that it is a valid URL.  For URL's which refer to the
           local file system, you are advised to use the `add_file_url'
           function instead, since it always creates valid URL's conforming
           to RFC2396.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT int add_file_url(const char *pathname, int url_idx=0);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Same as `add_url', except that this function creates a valid
           URL from the supplied `pathname'.  To do this, the function
           prepends a "file:///" protocol prefix and performs all required
           hex-hex encoding of characters which are not URI-legal, in
           accordance with RFC2396.
           [//]
           The `pathname' is assumed to be relative unless it commences with
           one of the prefixes "/", "\", "<D>:/" or "<D>:\", where "<D>" refers "
           to a single letter (this form is offered to accommodate
           MS-DOS style file names).  Relative file names are assigned the
           additional prefix "./" unless they already commence with a ".".
           Thus, the relative pathname "test" would be stored as
           "file:///./test".  For absolute pathnames, the initial "/" or
           "\" character is removed before prepending the "file:///" prefix.

           supplied to `get_url' should lie in the range 1 to N where
           N is the value returned by this function.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT int find_url(const char *url);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Searches for the supplied `url' string, returning its index if
           found and 0 otherwise.  Note that the 0 index is specially
           reserved for the main file, which contains the data reference
           box.  This does not correspond to any URL string.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT const char *get_url(int idx);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Returns the string associated with the `idx'th entry.  The
           function returns NULL if `idx' is less than 0 or greater than
           the value returned by `get_num_urls', indicating an illegal
           value.  If `idx' is 0, the function returns an empty string,
           meaning that the reference is to the main file which contains
           the data reference box.  Any other URL which happens
           to refer back to the same file (this can happen) will also
           have an empty string returned by this function.
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT const char *get_file_url(int idx);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is similar to `get_url', with the added feature that
           it checks whether the URL that would be returned can be construed
           as a local file.  If not, the function returns NULL.  Otherwise,
           it returns the relevant file's pathname, stripping out any
           "file://" prefix and decoding any hex-hex encoded characters
           (typically, but not necessarily, spaces in the original file name).
           [//]
           Although hex-hex decoding is performed on-demand, once a file
           pathname has been recovered for any particular URL `idx', the
           string is remembered internally.  As a result, this function
           always returns exactly the same string for each `idx' value.
           [//]
           If the returned pathname commences with the prefix "./" it is a
           relative path name -- relative to the path in which the current
           file is found.  Otherwise, it should be interpreted as
           an absolute path name.
