           list of byte ranges into one or more files (or URL's), identified
           by the `data_refs' object.  These together represent the contents
           of a virtual box, whose box type may be arbitrarily supplied
           using `box_type'.  Fragment lists may be found within fragment
           table boxes, in which case they refer to codestreams and
           `box_type' is best set to `jp2_codestream_4cc', since the
           present function allows the codestream to be read as though it
           were a contiguous codestream.  Fragment lists may also be found
           within cross reference boxes, in which case the box type should
           be set to that of the cross-referenced box.  In any case, the
           choice of box type has no impact on how the box will be read,
           provided only that it must not be 0.
         [RETURNS]
           The function currently always returns true.
         [ARG: ultimate_src]
           This argument must not be NULL.  It must point to the
           `jp2_family_src' object from which the fragment list information
           was read.  This is important, because the fragment list has
           a special way of referring back to this source.  If the ultimate
           data source for this object is a dynamic cache, rather than a
           file or `kdu_compressed_source' object, the `open_as' function
           will succeed, but all calls to `read' will fail to actually read
           any data.  This could change in the future, but for the moment
           it is a reasonable policy, since caching data sources are typically
           used by JPIP client-server applications and JPIP provides a
           more efficient and architecture neutral mechanism to completely
           bypass all fragment lists.
         [ARG: data_refs]
           This interface is allowed to be empty.  In this case, however,
           any call to `read' which requires access to a fragment with
           non-zero url index will fail to read into that fragment.

           This function plays a similar role to `set_standard_feature_support'
           but differs in the following respect.
           [//]
           All vendor features are, by default, NOT supported unless the
           internal implementation provides inherent support for some such
           feature (this could conceivably happen in the future, but is
           unlikely).
           [//]
           If the application itself offers support for some feature, it
           should add this feature explicitly here before calling the
           `test_fully_understand' or `test_decode_completely' functions.
           By contrast, all standard features are inherently supported,
           unless the internal implementation inherently does not support
           them.
         [ARG: uuid]
           Points to an array with 16 bytes (a 128 bit number), representing
           the relevant vendor feature's UUID.
         [ARG: is_supported]
           If true, support for this feature is being affirmed.  Otherwise,
           it is being declined.  Since all vendor features are unsupported

           both to identify the contents of the file and also to
           generate "fully understand" and "decode completely" expressions.
           [//]
           The "fully understand" and "decode completely" expressions are
           each evaluated by taking the logical AND of a collection of
           sub-expressions.  Each sub_expression is evaluated by taking the
           logical OR of a collection of features.  If any of the features
           identified by the sub-expression is available to the reader, that
           sub-expression evaluates to true.  If all sub-expressions
           evaluate to true, the corresponding "fully understand" or
           "decode completely" expression evaluates to true.  If there are
           no sub-expressions at all, the "fully understand" and
           "decode completely" expressions also evaluate to true.
           [//]
           For an explanation of the difference between the "fully understand"
           and "decode completely" expressions, see the comments appearing
           with the `test_fully_understand' and `test_decode_completely'
           functions.
           [//]
           In addition to the sub-expressions generated here, the `jpx_target'
           object builds its own sub-expressions to represent the features
           it knows about.  The features which it knows about are those
           marked with an asterisk in the list of standard features appearing
           with the `check_feature' function.  If any of those features
           are not explicitly used to form sub-expressions by means of the
           present function, they will be formed into sub-expressions which
           identify them as required both to completely decode and to fully
           understand the file's contents, wherever this makes sense.
         [ARG: feature_id]
           See the `check_standard_feature' function for a list of standard
           feature identifiers.
         [ARG: fully_understand_sub_expression]
           Indicates which sub-expression of the "fully understand" expression
           this feature is being added to.  The index has no particular
           meaning except to associate multiple features in the same
           sub-expression with one another.  However, valid
           sub-expression indices must lie in the range 0 to 254.  The
           special value of 255 means that the feature is not being added to
           any "fully understand" sub-expression.  This is useful if the
           feature is only to be added to "decode completely" sub-expressions.
           It also provides a useful mechanism for preventing the internal
           object from automatically asserting that the feature is required
           to fully understand the file, if that feature is believed to have
           been used.

       Manages the information associated with the composition box

       one composition box may be found in a JPX file, describing the
       generation of composited and/or animated images from the various
       compositing layers.
       [//]
       The object provides an interface which is more natural than simply
       supplying or retrieving compositing instructions to or from the
       JPX composition box.  This means that the object may need to do quite
       a bit of work to make things look simple for you.  There are some
       ways to abuse this so that a seemingly simple animation ends up being
       extremely costly to encode into a JPX composition box.  The main thing
       to watch out for is that you should avoid describing animations in
       which the composition layers are played backwards.  The JPX composition
       box is designed with the idea of using layers one after the other, with
       possible re-use of layers at later points in the animation.  It is
       possible to describe animations in which the layers are played from
       the last one back to the first one, but such a description will not
       be efficient and may not be handled efficiently by some JPX
       readers (should not affect Kakadu readers, if they are based on the
       `kdu_region_compositor' object).

           [//]
           Each frame may need to be repeated some number of times, as
           returned via the `repeat_count' argument, before moving to the

           composited image is played over and over again.  Instead, the
           actual layer indices associated with compositing instructions in
           the frame may need to be incremented between repeated frames.

           Each frame consists of a sequence of compositing instructions
           which must be performed in order to build up a single composited
           image.  Consecutive frames represent distinct composited images
           to be displayed at distinct time instants.
         [ARG: num_instructions]
           Used to return the number of compositing instructions used to
           compose the current frame.  Use `get_instruction' to examine the
           details of each instruction.
         [ARG: duration]
           Used to return the number of milliseconds between this frame and
           the next.  This value cannot be zero, except possibly in the last
           frame -- this should only be possible when the global looping
           count is 1, but some crazy content creator could do something
           weird.
         [ARG: repeat_count]
           Used to return the number of times (in addition to the first time)
           which the frame should be repeated.  If 0, the frame is not
           repeated.  If negative, the frame is repeated indefinitely.
           Repeated frames are separated by `duration' milliseconds.  Repeated
           frames do not necessarily use the same compositing layers in their
           instructions.  See `get_instruction' for more on the adjustment of
           compositing layer indices between repeatitions of a frame.
         [ARG: is_persistent]
           Used to return an indication of whether or not the effects of
           compositing this frame should be used as a background for all
           future composition operations.  To render any given frame, one
           must compose all preceding persistent frames in sequence, followed
           by the frame of interest.
           [//]
           Although this seems like a simple idea, in some circumstances
           (e.g., dynamic region-of-interest rendering) it can create an
           enormous amount of work.  For this reason, persistent frames are
           best avoided.  The `kdu_region_compositor' object goes to a lot
           of effort to figure out which persistent frames are actually
           visible (i.e., not completely covered by new opaque layers) so as
           to avoid composing hundreds or thousands of layers together where
           frame persistence has been misused.  Unfortunately, the visibility
           of persistent frames in later frames cannot properly be figured
           out within the `kdu_composition' object, since composition
           information (e.g., to figure out which layers are needed) may be
           required before the opacity of compositing layers has become
           available from a dynamic cache.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           The JPX composition box is built from a collection of instructions
           which each either add to the composition associated with the
           previous instruction or commence from scratch with a new
           composition surface.  Each instruction also has its own timing.
           These aspects are untangled here to create a set of distinct
           frames, each of which has its own set of compositing layers.
           [//]
           Each frame is composed by applying each of its compositing layers
           in turn to an initially blank compositing surface.  Each
           compositing layer is applied to the region of the compositing
           surface expressed by `target_dims', where the location parameters
           in `target_dims.pos' must be non-negative.  This region is
           generated by scaling (as required) the region of the source
           compositing layer described by `source_dims'.
           [//]
           Each instruction refers to exactly one compositing layer.  The
           index of this layer is returned via the `layer_idx' argument,
           but each time the frame is repeated (if the `repeat_count' returned
           via `get_next_frame' is non-zero), the layer index must be augmented
           by `increment' (might be 0).
         [RETURNS]
           False if `instruction_idx' is greater than or equal to the
           `num_instructions' value returned via `get_frame_info'.
         [ARG: frame_ref]
           Opaque pointer obtained from calls to `get_next_frame',
           `get_prev_frame' or `get_last_persistent_frame'.
         [ARG: instruction_idx]
           0 retrieves the first instruction in the frame.  Each successive
           instruction is retrieved using consecutive instruction indices,
           up to L-1, where L is the number of instructions returned
           by `get_next_frame'.
         [ARG: layer_idx]
           Used to return the index of the compositing layer (starting from
           0 for the first one in the JPX data source) to be used with this
           instruction.
         [ARG: increment]
           Amount to be added to `layer_idx' each time the frame is repeated.
           We are not referring here to global looping, as identified by
           the loop counter returned by `get_global_info'.  We are referring
           only to repetitions of the frame, as identified by the
           `repeat_count' value retrieved using `get_next_frame'.
         [ARG: is_reused]
           Used to retrieve a boolean flag indicating whether or not the
           compositing layer associated with this instruction will be reused
           in any subsequent instruction in this or any future frame.  This
           can be useful for cache optimization.
         [ARG: source_dims]
           Region to be cropped from the source composition layer to use
           in this instruction.  The `source_dims.pos' member identifies
           the location of the cropped region relative to the upper left
           hand corner of the image itself; its coordinates must be
           non-negative.  All coordinates are expressed on the compositing
           layer's registration grid.  For a description of the registration

      add_frame(int duration, int repeat_count, bool is_persistent);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to add a frame, specifying the number of
           milliseconds (`duration') until the next frame (if any) is to
           be started.  You must call this function at least once to cause
           a composition box to be written into the JPX file being generated
           by the `jpx_target' object which supplied the present interface.
           [//]
           Each frame can be repeated to create simple animations or movies.
           To make more sophisticated animations, you may need to explicitly
           add multiple frames.  Where a frame is repeated, the layer indices
           associated with the compositing layers within each frame may
           either remain fixed, or be advanced in a regular fashion.  For
           more on this, see `add_instruction'.
           [//]
           You must add at least one instruction to each new frame which
           you create.
         [RETURNS]
           The an opaque pointer which should be passed to `add_instruction'
           to define the individual compositing layers which will constitute
           the frame.
         [ARG: duration]
           Time between this frame and the next, measured in milliseconds.
           If the frame is repeated, this is the time between the repetitions
           and the time between the last repetition and any frame which
           follows.  You should not specify a zero-valued duration, except
           possibly for the last frame in the sequence. The duration of the
           last frame is completely irrelevant.
         [ARG: repeat_count]
           If 0, the frame is not repeated.  Otherwise, this is the number
           of times the frame is to be repeated.  A negative value means
           that the frame should be repeated indefinitely.  This only
           makes sense for the last frame to be added.
         [ARG: is_persistent]
           If true, the compositing instructions in this frame contribute
           to a background composition which is to be used by all subsequent
           frames.  Otherwise, the instructions in this frame contribute
           only to the rendering of the frame itself.
           [//]
           Although persistent frames sound like a good idea, you should
           try to avoid them.  One reason for this is that they make it
           difficult for a player to start from an arbitrary frame in the
           sequence.  Another more insidious reason is that persistent
           frames make it difficult to implement quality progressive
           compositions or dynamic rendering of regions of interest within
           a large composed image which cannot be fully stored in a buffer.
           The `kdu_region_compositor' object goes to a lot of effort to
           figure out which persistent frames can be ignored in such a
           rendering process, but it is far better as a content creator to
           simply avoid the use of persistent frames, or to use only a
           single persistent background frame.

         [ARG: layer_idx]
           Each instruction involves a single compositing layer, whose
           index is given here.  0 refers to the first compositing layer in
           the file.  If the frame is to be repeated, this is the index of
           the compositing layer to use in the first repetition.  Thereafter,
           the index is advanced by `increment' each time.
         [ARG: increment]
           Ignored unless the frame is repeated.  Each time the frame is
           repeated (see `repeat_count' argument to `add_frame'), the layer
           index is incremented by this value.  Frame repetition stops
           immediately if the layer index grows beyond the number of layers
           available from the file.  As an example, you might like to build
           a composite animation from a consecutive sequence of layers
           (`increment'=1) which are composed onto a fixed background layer
           (`increment'=0).
           [//]
           Note that there can be some weird sequences of layer increments
           which the internal machinery will not be able to represent
           efficiently.  As a general rule, you should try to use only
           positive and zero-valued increments (although negative increments
           are not forbidden) and you should try to use the same increments
           for all instructions in the frame.
         [ARG: source_dims]
           Specifies the cropped region within the compositing layer
           which is to be used by this instruction.  The region is
           expressed on the compositing layer's registration grid, as
           described with `jpx_layer_target::set_codestream_registration'.
         [ARG: target_dims]
           Specifies the region on the composition surface to which the
           cropped source region should be rendered.  This may involve
           some scaling.
           [//]
           Note, however, that compositing applications might not necessarily
           support arbitrary scaling factors.  Kakadu's powerful
           `kdu_region_compositor' object, for example, might not support
           anything other than integer-valued upsampling.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function, new to Kakadu v6.1, provides a method for
           determining the visibility of a codestream (or a region of interest
           defined on the codestream) in the overall composition associated
           with a given instance (given by `iteration_idx') of a given `frame'.
           One of the main applications for this function is determining
           whether a region-of-interest defined at the file-format level, for
           one or more codestreams, is visible in a frame, so that the next
           visible frame can be located and displayed when the region of
           interest is selected from a menu by an interactive user.  Under the
           same conditions, the function can be used to determine how suitable
           JPIP requests should be synthesized in response to the selection of
           a region of interest (e.g., by selection of an associated label
           from a text-based catalog), so that the relevant region can be
           efficiently fetched from a remote JPIP server.
           [//]
           The first four arguments have exactly the same interpretation as
           their namesakes in the `construct' function.  Unlike that function,
           however, the present function does not actually manipulate the
           internal structure of the object, so that it has no effect on the
           future return values of functions like `get_num_members',
          `has_covering_members' and the like.
           [//]
           Since a given codestream might appear multiple times in the
           construction of a frame from its various compositing layers, the
           function provides you with the option to walk through each layer
           in which the codestream (or an identified region of it) might be
           visible in the composition.  This is done via the optional
           `initial_matches_to_skip' argument.  The caller may use this
           argument to figure out the layer in which the codestream (or its
           region of interest) is most visible.  In most cases, however, the
           first match is a likely to be the most visible one, since the
           function works backwards from the top-most compositing layers to
           the bottom-most, the latter being more likely to be covered.
           [//]
           The function is only able to provide a conservative
           estimate of visibility, based upon intersecting the original
           region of interest with any opaque covering layers.  In particular,
           whenever an opaque layer covers the layer which contains this
           codestream's region of interest, the function estimates the
           visible portion of the region to be the largest rectangular
           subset of the original region, such that none of its rows and
           columns are completely covered.  Where multiple layers cover
           the region in complicated ways, this function may estimate the
           region to be visible even though it has been completely hidden.
           However, this is very unlikely.
         [RETURNS]
           The index of the compositing layer in which the codestream
           (or an identified region of the codestream) may be visible.
           A value of -1 is returned if no visible match is found.

           See `construct'.
         [ARG: codestream_idx]
           Index of the codestream, whose visibility is being tested.
         [ARG: composition_region]
           On entry, if this region is non-empty, it identifies a region on
           the composited frame, in which the visibility of the codestream
           (or its region) is of interest.  This may, for example, be a
           viewport being used by an interactive viewer.  If empty, the
           region is considered to be that of the entire composited frame.
           [//]
           On exit, the `composition_region' object is set to contain the
           region of the codestream (restricted to any supplied
           `codestream_roi') which is actually visible, as expressed in
           the coordinate system of the composited image.
         [ARG: codestream_roi]
           If this region is non-empty, it identifies a region of
           interest whose visibility we are testing, expressed with respect
           to the high resolution reference grid of the codestream in question,
           except that the location of the region is expressed relative to
           the origin of the image on the codestream, which might not always
           be the same as the origin of the high resolution reference grid
           itself (this is the same convention used by ROI description boxes
           in the JPX file format -- no accident).  If the region is empty,
           the region of interest is considered to be the entire codestream.
         [ARG: ignore_use_in_alpha]
           If true, the function ignores codestreams which are used only for
           generating opacity data for a compositing layer.  This is usually
           a good idea, since the file format only allows regions of
           interest to be specified on a per-codestream basis.  If the
           codestream contains some components which are used only for
           alpha blending channels and those components are used in some
           compositing layers which do not employ the actual imagery, it
           is unlikely that we will be interested in the region of interest
           within such layers.
         [ARG: initial_matches_to_skip]
           If zero, the function returns the first compositing layer in
           which the codestream (or its `codestream_roi') is visible
           (or visible within the originally supplied `composition_region').
           If this argument is set to 1, the function returns the second
           compositing layer in which the visibility conditions are found
           to hold; and so forth.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function resets the object to the empty state and then
           proceeds to add instructions from the supplied frame, starting
           from the last instruction (the one whose compositing layer will
           be painted on top of all the others) and working backwards (toward
           the background).  Each instruction contributes a single member,
           returned via `get_members', except for any instruction which is
           known to have no impact on the region of interest.  If the
           `region_of_interest' argument supplies an empty region, the
           region of interest is taken to be the entire composition
           surface.  In any event, an instruction has no impact on the region
           of interest if all imagery which it composits within that region
           lies underneath an existing opaque image region.
           [//]
           Note that it may not be possible to determine the opacity (or even
           size) of potential covering imagery if the relevant compositing
           layers are not yet accessible.
           [//]
           We say that a compositing layer is "not yet accessible" if the
           JPX data source is fueled by a dynamic cache which does not yet
           have sufficient contents to successfully access the layer using
           `jpx_source::access_layer'.  To clarify this important concept,
           we make the following two points:
           [>>] If we are able to determine that a relevant layer lies
                outside the range of compositing layers which can ever exist
                in the data source, we DO NOT think of the layer as
                "not yet accessible".  Instead, the function returns
                immediately with the object in its reset state (no members),
                since the frame does not really exist.  The way the JPX
                composition box works is that it is allowed to define frames
                which use non-existent layers, but once a reader encounters
                any such frame, it is supposed to ignore that frame and all
                subsequent frames.
           [>>] Apart from the condition mentioned above, a "not yet
                accessible" layer is one for which `jpx_source::access_layer'
                returns an empty interface, when called with a false value
                for its `need_stream_headers' argument.  Thus, a layer is
                deemed to be accessible if all the relevant JPX/JP2 boxes
                have been encountered, even if the relevant codestream
                main headers are not yet available.
           [//]
           Any instruction whose compositing layer is not yet accessible is
           included in the member list, even if it is known not to contribute
           to the region of interest, except if either of the following
           conditions occur:
           [>>] The composited imagery from this instruction is known to
                be globally invisible (not just within the region of interest,
                but not contributing to any part of the compositing surface);
                or
           [>>] The compositing layer already appears in some other
                contributing member instruction.
           [//]
           The reason for the above policy is that compositing layers are
           not accessible only if the JPX data source is being served by a
           dynamic cache, typically in a JPIP client-server application.  In
           order to open an interactive viewer for the frame, all relevant
           compositing layers will need to be accessible so a JPIP query will
           need to be formed which references the compositing layers which
           are not currently available.
           [//]
           The function stops examining instructions once the compositing
           surface is completely covered by opaque imagery.
           [//]
           If `follow_persistence' is true, the function continues to examine
           persistent frames which may lie beneath the current one, adding
           their instructions into the mix, until all persistent frames
           are accounted for.  It traverses the persistent frame list by
           using the `jpx_composition::get_last_persistent_frame' function.
           Again, this process stops if at any point the compositing
           surface is completely covered by opaque imagery.
         [RETURNS]
           False if any of the compositing layers which might contribute
           to the composited frame cannot yet be accessed via
           `jpx_source::access_layer', when invoked with a false value for
           its `need_stream_headers' argument.  In this case, calling the
           function again may result in a smaller number of members being
           added, since we might not yet be able to determine whether or not
           a layer is opaque or even whether it is hidden by another layer
           known to be opaque.
           [//]
           As noted above, we say that a compositing layer is not accessible
           only if insufficient information is currently available to open
           it or determine its existence.  If we can determine that any
           required compositing layer will never exist (by using
           `jpx_source::count_compositing_layers'), the present function will
           return true, but with the number of members set to 0.
         [ARG: source]
           JPX data source whose `jpx_source::access_composition' member
           was used to obtain the `jpx_composition' interface from which
           `frame' was recovered.
         [ARG: frame]
           An opaque pointer, recovered using `jpx_composition::get_next_frame'
           or any of the other member functions of `jpx_composition' which
           can be used to obtain frame references.
         [ARG: iteration_idx]
           Used to identify the particular frame within a repeated sequence.
           0 refers to the first frame.  The value supplied here may be as
           large as, but must be no larger than the repeat count returned
           via `jpx_composition::get_frame_info'.
         [ARG: follow_persistence]
           If true, the function examines persistent frames which form
           part of the background for the frame identified via `frame'.

           Use this function to walk through the frame instructions which
           were found to contribute to the frame composition when `construct'
           was called.  Each member represents one contributing instruction.
           If the `construct' function returned false, some of these
           instructions might turn out later to be non-contributing, at
           which point calling `construct' again will cause such instructions
           not to be included as members.
         [RETURNS]
           The frame to which this member instruction belongs.  This will
           always be identical to the frame supplied to `construct', unless
           the `follow_persistence' argument to that function was true, in
           which case it may be an earlier persistent frame.
           [//]
           Returns NULL if the requested member does not exist.
         [ARG: which]
           Identifies the specific member of interest, where a value of 0
           refers to the top-most member instruction, and a value one less
           than that returned by `get_num_members' refers to the bottom-most
           (background) member instruction contributing to the composed frame.
           Values less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of
           members will result in a NULL return.
         [ARG: instruction_idx]
           Used to return the index of the instruction within its frame.  This
           index may subsequently be passed to
           `jpx_composition::get_instruction', for example.
         [ARG: layer_idx]
           Used to return the index of the compositing layer associated with
           this member instruction.  This index may subsequently be passed
           to `jpx_source::access_layer'.
         [ARG: covers_composition]
           Used to return whether or not this member instruction is known to
           cover the compositing surface.  If the layer's size could not be
           determined completely at the time when `construct' was called
           (can happen only if the JPX data source is fueled by a dynamic
           cache which did not have enough information to open the
           compositing layer), this value will be set to false.
         [ARG: source_dims]
           Used to return the location and size of the source image region,
           relative to the complete source compositing layer.  The
           interpretation of this region is identical to that described
           with `jpx_composition::get_instruction', except that in the
           event that the source dimensions were not specified in the
           composition box and the composition layer is now accessible
           (guaranteed if the present function returns true), the source
           dimensions will automatically be set to represent the full
           compositing layer.  This saves the application the trouble of
           figuring out the missing information itself.
         [ARG: target_dims]
           Used to return the location and size of the imagery composited
           by this member instruction, expressed relative to the compositing
           surface.  The interpretation of this region is identical to that
           described with `jpx_composition::get_instruction', except that in
           the event that the target size was not specified in the composition
           box and the composition layer is now accessible (guaranteed if
           the present function returns true), the target size will
           automatically be set to be the same as the source size, which
           itself may be derived from the size of the compositing layer,
           if no source cropping was required.  This saves the application
           the trouble of figuring out the missing information itself.

           open multiple instances of the same codestream.  Regardless of

           Other less convenient ways exist to open an input box to access
           the codestream data.  One approach is to pass the locator

           prematurely, providing you with an opportunity to write the

           called again to resume the header generation process.

           interpretation for the `addr_param' value, allowing you to reliably
           cast it to some appropriate object reference.  Alternatively, you

           references to codestreams contained in external files.
      */

      add_fragment(const char *url_or_path, kdu_long offset, kdu_long length,
                   bool is_path=false);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function wraps up the functionalities of
           `jpx_fragment_list::add_fragment' and
           `jp2_data_references::add_url', working with the fragment list
           maintained by the present object and the data references object
           maintained by the containing `jpx_target' object.  The former
           may be recovered using `access_fragment_list', while the latter
           may be recovered using `jpx_target::access_data_references'.
           [//]
           The purpose of the fragment is to define the actual JPEG2000
           codestream described by this object in terms of a collection of
           references to byte ranges in (usually) external files/URL's.
           The concatenated list of fragments represents the complete
           codestream.  If you call this function, or add a fragment directly
           to the `jpx_fragment_list' object returned by
           `access_fragment_list', the codestream will be recorded using
           a fragment table box rather than a contiguous codestream box.
           For this reason, you must not invoke `open_stream' or
           `access_stream'.  Instead, before closing the containing
           `jpx_target' object, you should be sure to call
           `write_fragment_table'.
         [ARG: url_or_path]
           If NULL or an empty string, the fragment refers to a location
           in the current file -- the main JPX file.  In practice, this is
           unlikely to be possible unless you have written your own
           media data (mdat) box and buried the codestream inside it --
           a trick used commonly by Motion JPEG2000 files.
           [//]
           If non-NULL, this argument supplies either the raw URL string to
           be passed to `jp2_data_references::add_url', or a file path name
           (relative or absolute) to be passed to
           `jp2_data_references::add_file_url', depending on the `is_path'
           argument.
         [ARG: is_path]
           If true, a non-NULL `url_or_path' argument is treated as a local
           file path name and passed to `jp2_data_references::add_file_url'
           instead of `jp2_data_references::add_url'.  The path is assumed to
           be relative to the directory in which the main JPX file sits,
           unless it commences with one of the prefixes "/", "\",
           "<D>:/" or "<D>:\", where "<D>" refers to a single letter
           (this form is offered to accommodate MS-DOS style file names).
           For more on absolute and relative paths, see the
           `jp2_data_references::add_file_url' and
           `jp2_data_references::get_file_url' functions.

           normally accomplished by passing the resulting pointer to
           `kdu_codestream::create', but you may also write to the
           box directly (e.g., to copy a codestream from one file to
           another).
           [//]
           You may call this function only once, and you must close the
           returned box before attempting to open any other codestream
           box.  Furthermore, you must call `jpx_target::write_headers'
           first to generate the header information, after which you
           must open, write and close each codestream box in order.  If
           your application violates any of these conditions, an error
           will be delivered through `kdu_error'.
           [//]
           In many cases, you may wish to create a `kdu_codestream' object
           before the codestream box can be opened -- i.e., before the
           JPX file header can be written.  In particular, it is often
           convenient to use an open `kdu_codestream' to initialize the
           `jp2_dimensions' object.  The `access_stream' function enables
           you to obtain the interface required to create a `kdu_codestream'
           object prior to the point at which the present function is called,
           but note that you MUST at least call `open_stream' before making
           any attempt to flush codestream data with `kdu_codestream::flush'.
      */

           you to pass the returned interface to `kdu_codestream::create'
           before opening an output box.  This can be quite important, since
           it allows you to use the created `kdu_codestream' object to
           initialize `jp2_dimensions' and even to start compressing the
           imagery before actually writing the JPX file header.  Note,

           Note that the returned object cannot be written to until after

           Used to return horizontal and vertical alignment offsets.
           Specifically, the upper left hand sample of the code-stream's
           image region is located `alignment.x'/`denominator.x' samples
           to the right and `alignment.y'/`denominator.y' samples below
           the origin of this compositing layer's reference grid.  The
           JPX standard (accounting for corrigenda) requires these
           alignment offsets to lie in the half open interval [0,1), which
           means that 0 <= `alignment.x' < `denominator.x' and
           0 <= `alignment.y' < `denominator.y'.
         [ARG: sampling]
           Used to return horizontal and vertical sampling factors for the
           codestream.  Specifically, adjacent columns on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.x'/`denominator.x' samples on this compositing layer's
           reference grid.  Similarly, adjacent rows on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.y'/`denominator.y' samples on the compositing layer
           reference grid.
         [ARG: denominator]
           Used to return the denominator for the `alignment' and `sampling'
           expressions.  The values of `denominator.x' and `denominator.y' are
           guaranteed to be strictly positive.  Each compositing layer is
           guaranteed to have a single unique denominator, so that this
           argument will be set to the same values no matter what value is
           supplied for `which'.  This is true even if the value of `which'
           does not correspond to a valid codestream.

           channel mappings supplied via the interface returned by
           `access_channels', that codestream will be aligned directly with
           the compositing registation grid by default.  That is, the
           origin of the codestream's high resolution reference grid will
           be aligned with the origin of the compositing layer's registration
           grid, and the spacing between consecutive columns and rows on
           the codestream's reference grid will be exactly one column or
           row spacing (as appropriate) on the compositing layer's registration
           grid.  In this case, the dimensions of the composition layer will be
           the minima of the corresponding dimensions of each codestream.

           mapping rules via the `jp2_channels' interface functions.
           Codestream identifiers start from 0 and correspond exactly with
           the order in which the codestream will appear in the JPX file,
           which is also the order in which the `jpx_codestream_target'
           interfaces were created using `jpx_target::add_codestream'.
         [ARG: alignment]

           Specifically, the upper left hand sample of the code-stream's
           image region is located `alignment.x'/`denominator.x' samples
           to the right and `alignment.y'/`denominator.y' samples below
           the origin of this compositing layer's reference grid.  The
           JPX standard (accounting for corrigenda) requires these
           alignment offsets to lie in the half open interval [0,1), which
           means you must ensure that 0 <= `alignment.x' < `denominator.x'
           and 0 <= `alignment.y' < `denominator.y'.
           [//]
           Note also that `alignment' values must also lie in the
           range 0 to 255.
         [ARG: sampling]
           Supplies horizontal and vertical sampling factors for the
           codestream.  Specifically, adjacent columns on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.x'/`denominator.x' samples on this compositing layer's
           reference grid.  Similarly, adjacent rows on the codestream's
           high resolution reference grid are separated by
           `sampling.y'/`denominator.y' samples on the compositing layer
           reference grid.
           [//]
           Note that `sampling' factors must lie in the range 1 to 255.
         [ARG: denominator]
           Supplies the denominator for the `alignment' and `sampling'
           expressions.  The values of `denominator.x' and `denominator.y'
           must be strictly positive.  Each compositing layer may have only
           one unique denominator, so calling this function multiple times
           with different denominator values will cause an error to be
           generated through `kdu_error'.  Note that `denominator' values
           must lie in the range 1 to 65535.

           Configures the object to represent an elliptical region of

           supplies the elliptical representation in a manner which is
           directly compatible with the underlying JPX ROI representation.
           As such, if valid parameters are supplied on entry, the first
           form of the `get_ellipse' function will recover these same
           parameters exactly.  There is a second form of the `init_ellipse'
           function which can be used to initialize an ellipse based on its
           true axis lengths and angular orientation.  However, that function's
           parameters will be subjected to quantization.
           [//]
           Ellipses must be centred at an integer-valued location (Cx,Cy) on
           the relevant codestream's high resolution grid (measured with
           respect to the upper left hand corer on the encoded image on that
           grid).  This centre location is given by the `centre' argument.
           Ellipses must also be contained within a bounding box whose
           included edges have integer coordinates.
           [//]
           In the simplest case, with `skew'=(0,0), the ellipse's axes
           are oriented vertically and horizontally -- we refer to such an
           ellipse as "cardinally oriented".  In this case, the ellipse is
           fully characterized by its half-width (Wo=`extent.x') and
           half-height (Ho=`extent.y').  The elliptical region is then
           considered to include all locations (x,y) such that:
           [>>] (x - Cx)^2 / Wo^2 + (y - Cy)^2 / Ho^2 <= 1,
           [//]
           More generally, arbitrarily oriented elliptical regions are
           permitted.  It is a fundamental fact of geometry that any
           oriented ellipse can be obtained either by vertically skewing or
           by horizontally skewing a cardinally oriented ellipse.  In fact,
           any affine or perspective transformation of an ellipse is also
           still an ellipse (this may initially seem counter-intuitive for
           the case of perspective transformations).  In view of this, the
           `skew' argument simultaneously identifies two equivalent ways
           of obtaining the same ellipse by vertical or horizontal skewing.
           In fact, `skew' identifies the locations at which the oriented
           ellipse intercepts its bounding box.  In particular, the intercept
           with the top edge of the bounding box occurs at `centre.x'+`skew.x'
           and the intercept with the left edge of the bounding box occurs
           at `centre.y'-`skew.y'.  To see how the skewing procedures work,
           we first define the following quantities:
           [>>] alpha = `skew.x' / Ho -- horizontal skewing parameter
           [>>] beta  = `skew.y' / Wo -- vertical skewing parameter
           [//]
           The above parameters are necessarily coupled, if the horizontal and
           skewing procedures are to yield the same ellipse.  Specifically,
           we must have
           [>>] skew.x = round(Wo * gamma) and skew.y = round(Ho * gamma) for
                some parameter gamma in the range -1 < gamma < 1.
           [>>] Thus, alpha ~ Wo/Ho * gamma and beta ~ Ho/Wo * gamma.
           [>>] This means that alpha*beta ~ gamma^2.
           [//]
           The function internally adjusts `skew', if necessary, so as to
           ensure that -Wo < `skew.x' < Wo, -Ho < `skew.y' < Ho, Wo is within
           0.5 of Wo*gamma and `skew.y' is within 0.5 of Ho*gamma for some
           suitable gamma.
           [//]
           The horizontal and vertical skewing operations start with smaller
           ellipses which are identified by an inner half-width Wi and an
           inner half-height Hi.  These are obtained from
           [>>] Wi = Wo*sqrt(1-alpha*beta) = Wo*sqrt(1-gamma^2) and
           [>>] Hi = Ho*sqrt(1-alpha*beta) = Ho*sqrt(1-gamma^2).
           [//]
           The horizontal skewing procedure starts with a cardinally aligned
           ellipse of half-width Wi and half-height Ho and skews points at
           location (x,y) to (x-alpha*(y-Yc),y).  The skewed ellipse includes
           all locations (x,y) such that:
           [>>] (x-Cx+alpha*(y-Yc))^2 / Wi^2 + (y-Cy)^2 / Ho^2 <= 1.
           [//]
           The vertical skewing procedure starts with a cardinally aligned
           ellipse of half-width Wo and half-height Hi and skews points at
           location (x,y) to (x,y-beta*(x-Xc)).  The skewed ellipse includes
           all locations (x,y) such that:
           [>>] (y-Cy+beta*(x-Xc))^2 / Hi^2 + (x-Cx)^2 / Wo^2 <= 1.
           [//]
           Considering the definitions given above for the ellipse, it should
           be apparent that the smallest rectangularly shaped collection of
           locations (x,y) which could potentially belong to the ellipse is
           given by  Cx-Wo <= x <= Cx+Wo and Cy-Ho <= y <= Cy+Ho.
           Accordingly, the function sets the `region' member so that
           `region.pos' equals (Cx-Wo,Cy-Ho) and `region.size' equals
           (2*Wo+1,2*Ho+1).
           [//]
           The last two arguments supply values for the `is_encoded' and
           `coding_priority' member variables.

           the geometry in a more natural form.  While the first function
           tells the caller how to synthesize the elliptical region from
           a skewed cardinally oriented ellipse, the present function
           provides the lengths of the axes and the orientation of the
           axis which is closest to vertical.  Computing this information
           may take some time, since it requires the invocation of

           An array containing at least two elements, which are used to

           element holds V, the half-length of the axis which is closest to
           vertical, while the second holds U, the half-length of the axis
           which is closest to horizontal. The oriented ellipse is equivalent
           to a cardinally aligned ellipse with half-width U and half-height
           V, which has been rotated clockwise through an angle whose tangent
           is `tan_theta'.  This initial cardinally aligned ellipse contains
           all locations (x,y) such that: (x-Cx)^2/U^2 + (y-Cy)^2/V^2 = 1,
           where (Cx,Cy) is the `centre' location.

           Note that both U and V are guaranteed to be positive, but they
           are not generally integer-valued and they might be smaller than 1.

           found in `axis_extents'[0], expressed as tan(theta), where theta
           lies in the range -pi/4 to +pi/4 -- i.e., `tan_theta' lies in the
           range -1.0 to 1.0.  A value of 0 means that the ellipse is
           cardinally oriented.  Theta represents the the clockwise rotation
           of the vertical axis of a cardinally oriented ellipse with vertical
           and horizontal axis half-lengths (prior to rotation) of V and U,

           the larger of its dimensions as `length'.  Note carefully, that the
           "span" measured here recognizes a single sample as having a span
           of 1 unit.  This means that a rectangle which contains exactly one
           grid point has measured width and length values of 1.0, not 0.0.
           Similar considerations apply to all shapes.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, `width' is 1 more than twice the smaller of
           the two axis half-lengths returned via the second form of the
           `get_ellipse' function, while `length' is 1 more than twice the
           larger of the two axis half-lengths.  In this case, the function's
           return value is equal to 0 if the longer dimension is the one
           closer to horizontal and 1 if the longer dimension is the one
           closer to vertical.
           [//]
           For simple rectangular regions, as returned by `get_rectangle',
           the function returns the smaller of `region.size.x' and
           `region.size.y' via `width' and the larger of these two dimensions
           via `length'. In this case, the return value is equal to 0 if the
           longer dimension is horizontal and 1 if the longer dimension is
           vertical.

           For general quadrilateral regions, four bounding rectangles are
           considered, corresponding to the orientations of each of the
           quadrilateral edges.  In this case, the function's return value is
           an integer n in the range 0 to 3, such that the discovered tightest
           bounding rectangle has its longer dimension aligned parallel
           with the edge running from `vertices'[n] to
           `vertices'[(n+1) mod 4].

           that an average width for the collection of regions specified by
           an ROI description box should be measured using this function.
           This is done by taking a weighted average of the `width' values,
           weighted according to the `length' values, over all `jpx_roi'
           regions within a single ROI description box.

           [//]
           As with `measure_span', this function considers that every grid
           point within the region spans +/-0.5 from its centre, so that
           a rectangular region which contains exactly one grid point has
           an area of 1.0, as opposed to 0.0.  Similar considerations are

           and edges.  Thus, for example, a quadrilateral defined by the
           ordered vertices v1, v2, v3, v4 also contains all points on the
           line segments v1->v2, v2->v3, v3->v4 and v4->v1.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This is quite a sophisticated function.  It's objective is to
           find the Euclidean projection of point (`x0',`y0'),
           onto the boundary of the region, identifying the edge on which
           the projection is found and returning the projected point's
           coordinates via `xp' and `yp'.  The function also compares the
           Euclidean distance between (`x0',`y0') and the nearest point
           on the region with the supplied value of `max_distance'.  If
           this distance is exceeded, the function returns -1 and the
           `xp', `yp' values are undefined.  This is useful on a number of
           levels, but especially helps to improve efficiency, since it
           the iterative elliptical projection algorithm to be terminated
           early if we are sure that the distance will turn out to exceed
           `max_distance'.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, the problem solved here is not trivial
           and the algorithm could potentially be more efficient.  For
           quadrilateral regions, the function projects onto each edge in
           turn, determining the location which is closest to (`x0',`y0').
         [RETURNS]
           The function return -1 if the `max_distance' threshold is
           exceeded.  Otherwise, it returns a value in the range 0 to 3,
           identifying the edge on which (`xp',`yp') is located.
           [//]
           For quadrilateral regions, the returned edge index has the same
           interpretation as it does in the `check_edge_intersection'
           function.  Specifically, edge p runs from vertex p to
           vertex (p+1) mod 4.
           [//]
           For simple rectangular regions, the function does the same thing
           as for general quadrilaterals, treating the top-left corner as
           vertex 0, the top right hand corner as vertex 1 and so forth in
           the usual clockwise order.
           [//]
           For elliptical regions, there is only one (curved) edge, whose
           index is 0.
         [ARG: tolerance]
           Tolerance of the iterative projection algorithm used for elliptical
           regions.  The tolerance can be precisely interpreted as follows.
           The returned (`xp',`yp') location is the closest point (in
           the Euclidean sense) to (`x0',`y0') on a potentially scaled version
           of the true elliptical boundary, where the scaling factor is so
           close to 1 that (`xp',`yp') is guaranteed to be within a distance
           of `tolerance' (horizontally and vertically) of a point on the
           boundary of the true ellipse.  For very small values of `tolerance'
           this is essentially the same as a tolerance on the Euclidean
           distance between (`xp',`yp') and the true projection onto the
           elliptical boundary.
           [//]
           This argument has no effect for non-elliptical regions.

           this member holds the actual region of interest.  Otherwise, it
           hold the tightest bounding box for the quadrilateral which is
           described by the `vertices' array.  Note that `region.size'
           identifies the number of rows and columns of samples which are in
           the bounding box, so column `region.pos.x' lies inside the

           This member is used for describing arbitrary quadrilateral

           The vertices of the quadrilateral appear in clockwise order,
           starting with the top-most vertex (i.e., the one for which

           necessarily unique because there might be multiple top-most
           vertices, or the vertices could all be co-linear so that
           clockwise and anti-clockwise orderings are indistinguishable.
           These are not illegal conditions.

           Note that the edges of the quadrilateral are formed by the line
           segments joining entry 0 to entry 1, entry 1 to entry 2, entry 2
           to entry 3 and entry 3 back to entry 0 in the `vertices' array.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Modifies the internal state of the object by moving the currently
           selected anchor point (if any) to the `new_point'.  This may
           update many vertices and edges, since all regions/edges which
           have an anchor point at the same location as the selected one
           are moved together.

           move will occur by first invoking `can_move_selected_anchor'.
           If that function returns false due to the limited number of

      add_region(bool ellipses, kdu_dims visible_frame);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function adds a new elliptical region and/or a new
           quadrilateral or elliptical region to the editor, depending on
           the `ellipses' argument and the current editing mode.
           [>>] In `JPX_EDITOR_VERTEX_MODE' or `JPX_EDITOR_SKELETON_MODE',
                at most one region is added (an ellipse if `ellipses' is
                true, or else a quadrilateral).
           [>>] In `JPX_EDITOR_PATH_MODE', if `ellipses' is true, the function
                adds both a circle and a quadrilateral extension from the
                currently selected edge.  The circle helps to round the
                junctions created while editing paths.
           [//]
           The exact geometry of the added region or regions depends on the
           active edge associated with the currently selected region, as well
           as the editing mode.  The active edge is the one associated
           with the `JPX_EDITOR_STATE_SELECTED' flag in calls to `get_edge'
           and/or calls to `get_ellipse'.  The active edge advances each time
           `select_anchor' is called with the same anchor point and with
           the `advance' argument equal to true.  If there is no current
           selection, this function does nothing, returning an empty region.
           [//]
           The location and shape of the new region depends upon the
           active edge in a manner which is open to change in the future,
           but should be intuitive once the anchor point and edge
           information provided by `get_anchor' and `get_edge' are
           displayed to an interactive user.  In the event that there is
           no active edge associated with a selection, all edges associated
           with the selected anchor point must have zero length -- i.e.,
           both end-points identical.  If this happens, the location and
           size of the new region are based upon the selected anchor point
           itself.
           [//]
           The `visible_frame' argument provides a region, expressed with
           respect to the same coordinate system as the ROI region coordinates,
           which is visible within the graphical editor which is driving
           this object.  As a general rule, it is helpful to an interactive
           user if newly added regions fit within this frame and this is what
           the function endeavours to do.
           [//]
           It is possible that the function will refuse to add new regions
           because the number of region elements which a JPX ROI description
           box can hold is limited to 255.  If the number of elements consumed
           by the existing regions is larger than 253, the function will not
           add a new region, because the new region may require as many as
           2 elements to represent, unless it is a simple rectangle or
           a simple ellipse.
           [//]
           You cannot determine whether the above-mentioned limit is exceeded
           simply by monitoring the function's return value, as explained
           below.  However, you can explicitly call `measure_complexity'
           first; if the return value is greater than 0.99, the present
           function will not add a new region.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  Even if there is no change, this region might not
           be empty because the function invokes `cancel_drag'.
         [ARG: visible_frame]
           If this region is empty, no restrictions are imposed on the way
           in which a new region is added.  Otherwise, the function tries
           to add new regions in such a way that they fit (at least partially)
           within the `visible_frame' so that the effect of the operation is
           obvious to an interactive user.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function calculates the complexity of the region description
           currently being stored, expressed in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  The
           complexity is based on the number of individual region elements
           which would be required to represent the current configuration in
           a JPX ROI description box.  This value may not exceed 255.  Some
           quadrilateral/elliptical regions require two elements, while others
           require only 1.  Since the internal storage is sufficient to
           hold up to 255 quadrilaterals/elliptical regions, it is possible
           for the complexity to be as large as 2.0, yet configurations
           with complexity greater than 1.0 are not externally representable.
           [//]
           When the complexity becomes too high, `move_selected_anchor' may
           fail with a warning and `add_region' will not add anything.
           The `move_selected_anchor' function explicitly prevents any
           change which would cause the complexity to exceed 1.0, while
           `add_region' takes the conservative position that there must
           enough spare capacity to add an arbitrary ellipse or quadrilateral
           without exceeding a complexity of 1.0.  However, other functions
           like `split_selected_anchor' are not checked, since there is no
           risk of violating internal storage constraints.  This is OK,
           because such operations may be precursors to editing operations
           which may restore the limit.  In any case, an application can
           always explicitly call this function after performing any editing
           operation and then execute `undo' if the operation is not suitable.
         [RETURNS]
           A value in the range 0.0 to 2.0, where 1.0 is the maximum complexity
           that can be externalized to a JPX ROI description box.

      add_scribble_point(kdu_coords point);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Provides a service for accumulating points which define a
           "scribble path".  Successive points along the path are assumed
           to be connected in some way (not necessarily by straight line
           segments).  Typically, these points correspond to successively
           detected mouse locations while an interactive user moves
           the mouse with a button held down.  However, they could be
           generated from any number of other application-dependent
           processes.  One reason for accumulating scribble paths in
           this object is that the `undo' and `redo' functions will then
           automatically manage the scribble paths as well, which facilitates
           the implementation of an interactive editor.
           [//]
           One noteworthy feature of the current function is that it
           automatically eliminates loops in the evolving scribble path.
           Thus, as points are added, the total number of points in the
           path (as returned by `get_scribble_path') may actually decrease.
           The function detects a loop whenever the line segment joining the
           newly added point and the previous one intersects or touches the
           line segment joining any existing pair of consecutive scribble
           points.  Upon detection, the function removes either the loop or
           the leading section of the scribble path, whichever is shorter,
           in such a way as to ensure that no scribble point so much as
           touches any other scribble point or any line segment between
           adjacent scribble points.
           [//]
           Also, if some internal limit on the maximum number of scribble
           points is exceeded, the function reduces the path complexity by
           sub-sampling points that have already been collected.  This
           process may also cause the number of points identified by
           `get_scribble_points' to decrease discontinuously as points
           are progressively added.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  This might be larger than you think if some
           sub-sampling occurred, or loops were removed.
         [ARG: point]
           Points have the same interpretation as all other locations managed
           by the editor; i.e., each point corresponds to a location on
           the high resolution canvas coordinate system of some codestream,
           measured with respect to the origin of the image in that codestream.

           This function converts the sequence of points most recently
           supplied to `add_scribble_points' (i.e., since the last call to
           `clear_scribble_points') into a sequence of quadrilaterals and/or

           managed by the editor; otherwise, the new regions are added.
           It is possible that the complexity of the representation is too
           high to be stored internally, in which case the function returns
           an empty region and does nothing.  Even if the function succeeds,

           approximation depend upon the `conversion_flags' and `accuracy'
           arguments.

           Note that this function does not clear the scribble points, even

         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  This region is guaranteed to be empty if and
           only if the scribble path could not be converted with
           the requested `accuracy'.  This is more likely, of course, if
           `replace_content' is false, since then the resources available
           for representing the approximation are further constrained by
           the existing regions which the editor is managing.
         [ARG: replace_content]
           If true, the function removes all regions which it is managing
           before adding quadrilaterals/ellipses to approximate the scribble
           path.  If the function returns false, however, nothing is erased.
           In any case, you can always get any deleted regions back again
           via the `undo' operation.
         [ARG: conversion_flags]
           Any combination of the `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_FILL' and
           `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ELLIPSES' flags may be used here, with the
           following implications:
           [>>] `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_FILL' and `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ELLIPSES' --
                In this case, the function generates a collection of
                ellipses and/or quadrilaterals, which form a single connected
                region, whose boundary approximates the scribble path to
                within a tolerance which is ultimately determined by the
                `accuracy' value.  Initial implementations of this mode may
                not actually introduce ellipses, but the idea is eventually
                to use ellipses to approximate convex portions of the boundary
                wherever this is efficient.
           [>>] `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_FILL' only -- in this case, the function
                uses quadrilaterals only to create a single connected region
                (a polygon) whose boundary approximates the scribble path,
                to within a tolerance determined by the `accuracy' values.
           [>>] `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ELLIPSES' only -- in this case, the function
                approximates the scribble path itself with a collection of
                connected line segments (quadrilaterals which have only two
                distinct vertices) and inserts circles of radius 1 at the
                end-points of every line segment.  If the `set_path_thickness'
                function is subsequently used to widen the resulting path,
                these circles will serve to provide rounded corners.
           [>>] 0 -- in this case, the function behaves as above, except that
                no junctions are inserted.  If the path is subsequently
                widened with `set_path_thickness', it will have a strictly
                polygonal boundary.
         [ARG: accuracy]
           This argument takes a value in the range 0.0 to 1.0, whose
           interpretation is left up to the internal implementation.  As
           expected, larger values should more closely approximate
           the path defined by the scribble points, but the scale is
           non-linear.  The accuracy is also relative to the size of the
           region defined by the scribble path.  As a general rule, a
           value of 0.5 is intended to provide a moderate level of
           approximation, which is usable but usually far from perfect.  A
           value of 1.0 will cause the function to approximate the scribble
           path to within an error of at most 1 grid point.  No higher
           accuracy values make any sense.

           This powerful function modifies all "path brick" regions, as
           defined under `enum_paths', so as to ensure that the
           "thickness" of the regions which define path segments is as
           close as possible to the supplied value.  Only true path bricks
           are modified, as opposed to "potential path bricks".
           The function also modifies any elliptical region whose centre lies
           at the end-point of a path segment, setting such ellipses to
           circles whose diameter is as close as possible to `thickness'.
           [//]
           The function is careful not to alter the path segments themselves
           in any way.  The thickness of a path brick is defined to be
           the distance between the two edges which run on either side of

           [>>] If the end of a path segment lies at an edge which is not
                a compatible edge, or which is shared with an ellipse (as
                defined above), that edge is aligned perpendicularly to the
                path segment.
           [>>] If the end of a path segment lies at a compatible edge of
                non-zero extent (i.e., the end-points of the edge are not
                the same point), which is not shared with any ellipse, the
                edge is modified simultaneously in both quadrilaterals, so as
                to preserve the sharing property.  If both quadrilaterals are
                path bricks, this is done in such a way that the thicknesses
                of both path bricks is established.
           [//]
           Note that the `thickness' value is interpreted with respect to the
           notion that each individual sample point has a size of 1x1.
           Thus, a `thickness' of 1 means that each path brick has only two
           distinct vertices, so that the path brick region is actually a
           line which coincides with the path segment itself.  As a general
           rule, it is better to request odd valued `thickness' values, since
           path bricks which run horizontally or vertically can achieve
           such thicknesses precisely.
           [//]
           It is worth noting that isolated path bricks (i.e., quadrilateral
           regions which do not share any edges with other quadrilaterals)
           must not be as thick as their path segment is long -- otherwise,
           the path segment would switch to run between the opposite two
           edges (see the explanation under `enum_paths').  The
           function imposes this restriction automatically.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.
         [ARG: success]
           Used to indicate whether or not the operation was able to
           successfully modify all path bricks and path junctions.  If
           none of them were modified, or only a subset were modified, the

           to true.

    fill_closed_paths(bool &success, int required_member_idx=-1);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function is essentially used to convert
           paths into filled polygon regions.  The principle intent is
           to allow an interactive user to map out the boundary of a
           polygon region by drawing a path around it -- usually done in
           the `JPX_EDITOR_PATH_MODE' editing mode -- and then convert the
           path into a filled polygon.  As described under `enum_paths', a
           "path" is defined by a collection of connected "path segments",
           where each path segment arises from a quadrilateral region with
           simple connectivity.
           [//]
           This function uses `enum_paths' internally to enumerate all the
           paths associated with the current configuration.  It considers
           only closed paths (those whose `path_start' and `path_end'
           coordinates are identical, as returned via `enum_paths').  If
           `required_member_idx' is -ve, the function fills all closed
           paths.  Otherwise, it fills only the closed path (if any) which
           includes `required_member_idx' amongst its members (as returned
           via the `path_members' array passed to `enum_paths').
           [//]
           For each filled path, the function effectively deletes all the
           path bricks for that path (these are the quadrilateral regions
           whose indices are returned via the `path_members' array passed
           to `enum_paths') and replaces them with new quadrilateral
           regions which fully partition the region contained within the
           external edges of the original path bricks.  Several things are
           worth noting here:
           [>>] The filled region fully covers all the original path bricks
                which comprised the path, rather than stopping at the
                path segments themselves, which run down the middle of their
                path bricks.
           [>>] The filled region is partitioned into quadrilaterals,
                meaning that the filling quadrilaterals do not overlap.
           [>>] The filling quadrilaterals meet one another at their vertices.
                No vertex of one filling quadrilateral lies meets an edge
                of another filling quadrilateral at an intermediate position.
           [>>] Connected path bricks either share a common edge or else
                the edge mid-points which define their respective path
                segments are identical.  This second condition means that
                the path bricks which define the boundary of the filled
                region are not necessarily joined at their vertices.
                Nevertheless, the filling quadrilaterals which span these
                path bricks and the entire interior of the closed path do
                join at their vertices.
         [RETURNS]
           A region large enough to include all points and edges affected
           by the change.  This region will be empty if the function does
           nothing at all, because there are no appropriate paths to fill.
         [ARG: success]
           Used to return an indication of whether or not the function
           ran to completion.  The value may be set to false, even if the
           function has a non-empty return region, if the number of regions
           required to complete the filling procedure exceeds the internal
           storage capacity, in which case the maximum complexity would
           definitely be exceeded by the requested operation.  It may be
           a good ideal to call `measure_complexity' anyway after this
           function returns, if you want to be sure that the filled polygons
           can be completely saved in a JPX ROI description box, since
           internal storage is usually sufficient to exceed the maximum
           allowable complexity of a JPX ROI description box.
         [ARG: required_member_idx]
           If non-negative, the function only processes closed paths
           which include, as one of their members, the region with index
           `required_member_idx' -- there can be at most one of these, since
           separate invocations of `enum_paths' return disjoint collections
           of path members.  This index may, for example, be the index of
           a currently selected region, as returned by `get_selection'.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to walk through all the "paths" which are
           associated with the current configuration, discovering the
           participating regions as you go.  To use this function,
           you must first understand how paths are defined.  Before we do
           this, however, we point out that the function retrieves an entire
           collection of connected regions in one go, returning their
           inidices via the 255-element `path_members' array and setting a
           single bit flag in the 8-element `path_flags' array for each
           region which is found to belong to the path.  When calling this
           function for the first time, all 8 members of the `path_flags'
           array must be equal to 0.  To enumerate subsequent paths, the
           function may be called again, passing in the same `path_flags'
           values (without re-initializing it).  The function uses this
           information to discover the first path which has not yet been
           enumerated, if any.
           [//]
           A "path" is formed by quadrilateral regions with simple
           connectivity, as explained below.  Paths can be understood as the
           skeletal representation of this connectivity, around which the
           region boundaries can be expanded or contracted using the powerful
           `set_path_thickness' function.  Path junctions can be formed
           using ellipses or by simple sharing of edges between quadrilateral
           regions.  Paths provide a natural formalism for many interactive
           shape editing operations, but they also provide a means for
           calculating geometric properties of regions of interest.
           [//]
           We begin by pointing out that a path is composed of a collection
           of connected path segments, each of which is the line segment
           which joins the mid-points of opposing edges of some quadrilateral.
           The quadrilateral in question is called a "path brick" and all
           path bricks are members of the path.  Ellipses do not themselves
           contribute path segments, but their presence may contribute to
           the determination of which quadrilateral edges are used to
           define path segments.  Moreover, ellipses which are centered at
           the end-points of any path segment are considered to be members
           of the path.
           [//]
           Intuitively, a path brick is a long, thin region, which contributes
           a single "path segment" that runs down the middle between the
           mid-points of its opposite edges.  Formally, we define a path brick
           and its associated path segment as follows:
           [>>] A quadrilateral is said to have a "compatible edge" if: (a) the
                edge has identical end-points to an edge in exactly one other
                quadrilateral; or (b) the mid-point of the edge is the centre
                of some ellipse (the geometry of the ellipse is irrelevant);
                or (c) the end-points of the edge are identical (i.e., the
                edge is a single point).  Any or all of these three conditions
                may hold.  Thus, for example, a compatible edge might be
                shared by two or more other quadrilaterals so long as its
                mid-point coincides with the centre of an ellipse.
           [>>] A "triangle" is a quadrilateral region which has only three
                distinct vertices.
           [>>] A "singularity" is a quadrilateral region, in which all
                vertices coincide.
           [>>] A quadrilateral is said to have a "multiply shared edge" if
                that edge has identical end-points to an edge in two or more
                other quadrilaterals and it does not satisfy the conditions
                for being a "compatible edge".
           [>>] A quadrilateral region is a "potential path brick" if it is
                not a triangle, not a singularity, has no multiply
                shared edges and it has one of the following:
                (a) no compatible edges; (b) 1 compatible edge; or (c)
                2 opposing compatible edges (i.e., compatible edges with no
                common vertex).  In case (b), the region's path segment runs
                between the mid-point of the compatible edge and the
                mid-point of the opposing edge.  In case (c), the region's
                path segment runs between the mid-points of the two compatible
                edges.  In case (a), the region's path segment runs between
                the two opposing edges which are furthest apart.
           [>>] A quadrilateral region which is a potential path brick is
                said to be an actual "path brick" only if its path segment
                has non-zero length and is fully contained within the
                quadrilateral region.  Only true path bricks actually
                contribute path segments.
           [//]
           In the event that a path contains junctions -- i.e., where a
           path segment shares its end-point with more than one other
           path segment -- the function considers each branch from the
           junction to be a separate path.  The function essentially
           finds a novel path brick and then builds out from it until
           it comes back to itself (a loop) or encounters a junction.  One
           implication of this is that the function can only return a complete
           closed path if it has no junctions.  This is deliberate, because
           junctions make it possible otherwise to interpret closed paths
           in many different ways.  If you wish to discover closed paths
           with junctions you can assemble the results produced by multiple
           invocations of this function and analyze their `path_start'
           and `path_end' coordinates.
         [RETURNS]
           Returns the number of regions which participate in the path.  If
           this is 0, there are no more paths.  Otherwise, the return value
           corresponds to the number of entries of `path_members' which have
           been set by this function.
         [ARG: path_flags]
           An array with at least 8 elements, whose entries together provide
           256 bit flags, which correspond to individual regions that may
           belong to current or previous paths.  On entry, if a flag is set,
           the corresponding region is a member of a previously enumerated
           path.  On exit, flags corresponding to members of the current path
           are also set.
         [ARG: path_members]
           An array containing at least 255 entries (to be sure there will be
           no overwriting).  The function writes the indices of each region
           which participates in the path into this array, where the number
           of such regions is the function's return value.  Note that the
           path members are written to this array in sequence, so that
           consecutive members are connected via path segments.  Path members
           include both path bricks and ellipses whose centres lie on one
           of the end-points of a path segment.  Where ellipses are included
           in the returned path members, they are considered as zero length
           path segments whose end-points lie at the centre of the ellipse,
           for the purpose of establishing a return sequence.
           [//]
           Region indices have the same interpretation as in the
           `get_selection', `get_region', `modify_region' and
           `get_path_segment_for_region' functions.
           [//]
           The path members returned by each successive invocation of this
           function (assuming you do not re-initialize `path_flags' in between)
           are guaranteed to be disjoint.
         [ARG: path_start]
           Used to return the coordinates of one end of the path, corresponding
           to the first member returned via `path_members'
         [ARG: path_end]
           Used to return the coordinates of the opposite end of the path,
           corresponding to the last member returned via `path_members'.  If
           the path is a closed loop, `path_end' will be identical to
           `path_start'

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Similar to `get_anchor', this function is used to walk through all
           the straight edges of individual regions within the current edit
           state.  The separate function `get_curve' should be used to
           walk through the boundaries of elliptical regions.
           [//]
           Each individual region can represent at most an arbitrary
           quadrilateral, so there will be at most 4 edges per region.
           In multi-region ROI's, regions will typically share common edges,
           so this function may return multiple copies of the same edge.
         [RETURNS]
           A combination of the following flags (or 0 if the requested edge
           does not exist):
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_NZ' flag provides a means of
                ensuring the return value is non-zero; this flag has no
                special meaning.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ENCODED' flag means that the edge
                belongs to a region which is marked as "encoded", meaning that
                ROI encoding procedures have been used within that region in
                the relevant codestream.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SELECTED' flag means that the edge
                has been selected -- a graphical user interface should somehow
                highlighted a selected edge in a manner which identifies
                which region the selected edge belongs to (since regions
                may frequently have common edges).  To do this, you should
                note that the vector from `from' to `to' corresponds to
                a clockwise traversal of the relevant region's boundary.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SHARED' flag means that the edge is
                shared with at least one edge of another quadrilateral --
                that is, both end-points of the edge are identical to
                end-points of an edge in another quadrilateral.  The function
                never includes this flag unless the `want_shared_flag' argument
                is true, since it takes some extra effort to determine
                the shared status of edges.
         [ARG: selected_region_only]
           If true, the function enumerates edges only from the currently
           selected region (if there is one) -- this is determined by the
           most recent call to `select_anchor'.
         [ARG: dragged]
           If true, the function returns only those edges which
           are affected by a drag operation -- see `drag_selected_anchor'.
           If false, only the existing edges are returned -- i.e.,
           ignoring the effect of any drag operation.
         [ARG: want_shared_flag]
           If true, the function determines the shared status of each edge
           so that the `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SHARED' flag can be set correctly.
           Otherwise, the return value never includes `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SHARED'.

         [RETURNS]
           A combination of the following flags (or 0 if the requested ellipse
           does not exist):
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_NZ' flag provides a means of
                ensuring the return value is non-zero; this flag has no
                special meaning.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_ENCODED' flag means that the elliptical
                region is marked as "encoded", meaning that ROI encoding
                procedures have been used within that region in the relevant
                codestream.
           [>>] The `JPX_EDITOR_FLAG_SELECTED' flag means that the elliptical
                boundary has been selected -- a graphical user interface
                should somehow highlighted this fact.
         [ARG: centre]
           Used to return the location of the centre of the ellipse.
         [ARG: extent]
           Used to return the half-width Wo=`extent.x' and the half-height
           Ho=`extent.y' of the tightest bounding box for the ellipse -- see
           `jpx_roi::init_ellipse' for a discussion of these parameters.
         [ARG: skew]
           Used to return the locations at which a potentially oriented
           ellipse intersects its bounding box.  The intercept with the
           top edge of the bounding box occurs at `centre.x'+`skew.x'.  The
           intercept with the left edge of the bounding box occurs at
           `centre.y'-`skew.y'.  See `jpx_roi::init_ellipse' for more
           explanation.
         [ARG: selected_region_only]
           If true, the function skips all but the current region (if there
           is one) -- this is determined by the most recent call to
           `select_anchor'.
         [ARG: dragged]
           If true, the function returns only those elliptical boundaries which
           are affected by a drag operation -- see `drag_selected_anchor'.
           If false, only the existing ellipses are returned -- i.e.,
           ignoring the effect of any drag operation.

           Path segments are defined in connection with the `enum_paths'

  /* Notes:
       The `init' function sets up the `vertices' member of each elliptical
     or rectangular `jpx_roi' structure to hold the extreme points of the
     region.  For rectangular regions, these are the vertices, running in
     clockwise order from top-left.  For elliptical regions, these are the
     end-points of the major and minor axes, adjusted slightly (if required)
     to coincide with vertices of non-elliptical regions.  Whenever extreme
     points may need to be regenerated, the `update_extremities' function is
     invoked.
       The extreme points of adjacent regions are considered to be connected
     (and hence move together) if they have the same locations.
       The `drag_flags' array is configured whenever a new anchor point is
     selected.  It contains one byte for each region, identifying which of
     its extreme points are required to move when the selected anchor point is
     dragged/moved.  All of these extreme points must move together in the
     current implementation.  Only the least significant 4 bits of each byte
     are actually used to identify the extremities which must move.
       The interpretation of `edge_idx' is as follows.  Elliptical regions
     are considered to have 3 edges: an `edge_idx' of 0 means the ellipse
     itself, while values of 1 and 2 correspond to the horizontal and
     vertical axes respectively.  For quadrilateral regions, the `edge_idx'
     has the same interpretation as that identified for `jpx_roi'.
     Specifically an `edge_idx' of E refers to the edge running from
     vertex E to vertex (E+1) mod 4.
       The `path_edge_flags' array is used to identify and work with paths.
     If `path_edge_flags_valid' is false, the `find_path_edge_flags' function
     is called, to update this array.  Each entry in the array identifies
     information for the corresponding region.  The least significant 4 bits
     of each entry identify the edges which are shared with exactly one
     other quadrilateral and not with any ellipse, starting from the edge
     with index 0 in the LSB.  The indexing of edges follows the same policy
     as `jpx_roi::check_edge_intersection'.  The two MSB's have the following
     interpretation: 0 means not a path brick; 1 means a path brick whose
     path segment runs between edges 0 and 2; 2 means a path brick whose
     path segment runs between edges 1 and 3; 3 means an ellipse whose
     centre coincides with the end-point of a path segment.
       The `shared_edge_flags' array maintains information about which edges
     are shared with others.  A shared edge is one for which both end-points
     are in common with another edge.  The `shared_edge_flags_valid' member
     keeps track of whether this information needs to be regenerated from
     scratch or not.  The information is used to help the `get_edge'
     function correctly report the shared/unshared status of edges which
     it returns, without having to conduct a full search.  Only the 4 LSB's
     of each byte are used and they are associated with edges in the same
     way as the four LSB's of each byte in the `path_edge_flags' array.

/*****************************************************************************/

class jpx_metanode {
  /* [BIND: interface]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       This object is used to interact with an internal metadata tree,
       which is created to reflect the associations between metadata in
       a JPX file.  By metadata, here we mean all of the box types
       described in connection with the `jpx_meta_manager::set_box_filter'
       function, plus any association (`asoc') boxes and the first sub-box
       of any association box.  Boxes which are not represented by this
       object are those which are directly related to rendering the
       compressed imagery.  Typical examples of boxes managed by the object
       are XML boxes, number list boxes, label boxes, ROI description boxes,
       UUID boxes, IP-rights boxes and Cross-Reference boxes.
       [//]
       Each intermediate node in the tree (i.e. everything other than the root
       and the leaves) corresponds to an association relationship, which could
       be represented using a JPX association (`asoc') box.  In some cases,
       the relationship might be represented by some other means, such
       as inclusion of the relevant metadata within a codestream header or
       compositing layer header box, but it is easiest to understand the
       tree structure by assuming that each intermediate node corresponds
       to exactly one association box.  The first sub-box of an association
       box plays a special role, describing an entity to which all subsequent
       sub-boxes are to be associated.  These subsequent sub-boxes are
       represented by the node's descendants (branches in the tree), while
       the contents of the first box are considered to belong to the node
       itself.
       [//]
       In cases where the first sub-box of an association is itself an
       association box, it is unclear exactly what association was
       intended.  For this reason, we do not include the first sub-box of
       an association amongst the descendants of a node.  All other sub-boxes
       are treated as descendants (branches) whose nodes may be further
       split if they contain association boxes.
       [//]
       There are two important cases for the first sub-box of an association
       box, as follows:
         [>>] If the first sub-box of an association is a number list (`nlst')
              box, all descendants of the node are associated with the image
              entities listed in the number list box.  These entities may be
              codestreams, compositing layers, or the entire composited image.
         [>>] If the first sub-box of an association is an ROI description
              (`roid') box, all descendants of the node are associated with
              the rectangular and/or elliptical regions described by that
              box.
       [//]
       The above two special cases are represented explicitly and the
       association parameters may be explicitly created and retrieved
       via the various member functions offered by the `jpx_metanode'
       interface.
       [//]
       As mentioned previously, the associations embodied by an
       intermediate node in the metadata tree might not necessarily arise
       from the appearance of an `asoc' box within the JPX file.  In
       particular, wherever any of the metadata boxes mentioned above appears
       within a codestream header or a compositing layer header box, the
       metadata will be treated as though it had been contained within an
       `asoc' box whose first sub-box was a number list box which referenced
       the relevant codestream or compositing layer.  When the information
       in a `jpx_metanode' tree is used to write a new JPX file, however,
       all associations will be formed using `asoc' boxes, rather than by
       inclusion within codestream header or compositing layer header boxes.
       [//]
       Leaves in the tree have no descendants.  A leaf node represents a
       single JP2 box, which is not further divided through the use of
       `asoc' boxes.
       [//]
       In the above, we have described intermediate nodes and leaf nodes.
       The one additional type of node is the tree root, to which access
       is granted using `jpx_meta_manager::access_root'.  All descendants
       of the root node correspond to metadata which (at least notionally)
       resides at the top level of the file.  Whereas intermediate nodes
       have their own box, which corresponds to the first sub-box of an
       association box (whether real or implied), the root node has no
       box of its own; it has only descendants and its box-type is
       returned as 0.
       [//]
       The `jpx_metanode' interface is designed to meet the needs of file
       readers and file writers, including incremental file parsers, which
       may be accessing a JPX data source which is being supplied by a
       dynamic cache whose contents are written in some arbitrary order by
       a remote JPIP server.  Both reading and writing functions may be
       used together to interactively edit an existing metadata tree.  For
       this reason, provision is made to read boxes which are described by
       any of the methods allowed during writing, including boxes which
       are described by reference to an existing node (possibly in another
       metadata tree) and boxes which are described by placeholders which
       are used to defer box generation until the file is actually being
       written.
       [//]
       For the added convenience of incremental readers, editors and other
       interesting applications which may interact with JP2/JPX metadata,
       the `jpx_meta_manager' object provides methods for retrieving metanodes
       based on the file address of their constituent boxes, for enumerating
       metanodes based on their association with image entities and/or
       regions of interest, and for efficiently scanning through metanodes
       which have been recently parsed from the data source or changed
       by editing operations.  Furthermore, the `jpx_metanode' interface
       provides methods for identifying whether a node has been changed
       by editing operations and for saving an application-defined pointer
       (usually a pointer into some data structure maintained by the
       application).  Together, these features can be used to efficiently
       track changes in the metadata structure due to editing or incremental
       reading of a data source (typically, as it becomes available from a
       dynamic cache).
       [//]
       From version 6.2, Kakadu also provides extensive support for
       discovery, creating, copying and writing metadata links.  A metadata
       link is represented in the JPX file using a cross-reference box,
       which points to the contents of another box.  Cross-reference boxes
       may potentially be used for many things and in many ways, but Kakadu
       exploits them to represent links between nodes in the metadata tree,
       allowing for the construction of arbitrary graphs.  The most natural
       interpretation of a cross-reference box which points to another box
       is that the referenced box should be treated as though it appeared
       in place of the cross-reference box.  Keeping this in mind, if a
       cross-reference box points to an `asoc' box, Kakadu treats the
       cross-reference as a link to the entire sub-tree embedded within that
       asoc box -- such links are termed "Alternate Child" links and assigned
       a `jpx_metanode_link_type' of `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK'.
       Cross-references which point to leaves in the metadata tree (i.e., to
       non-asoc boxes which are not the first sub-box of an asoc box) are
       also interpreted as "Alternate Child" links.  Applications may
       choose to follow alternate child links to the `jpx_metanode' to which
       they point, interpreting that node and all its descendants as though
       they were additional descendants of the node in which the link (i.e.,
       the cross-reference) is found.
       [//]
       Kakadu also defines two other types of cross-reference linking
       relationships, known as "Grouping links" and "Alternate Parent"
       links, whose semantics are useful in constructing metadata graphs.
       Although the interpretation of internal cross-references is not
       made clear in the standard itself, Kakadu's interpretations and usage
       are natural and intuitive.  For more information on links and link
       types, see the `get_link' and `add_link' member functions, as well as
       the powerful graph parsing function, `find_path_to'.
       [//]

       interfaces to an internal object, which cannot be directly created
       by an application.  Use the member functions offered by

      get_numlist_info(int &num_codestreams, int &num_layers,
                       bool &applies_to_rendered_result);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Use this function to determine whether or not the node is
           represented by a number list.  A number list is a list of
           image entities: codestreams; compositing layers; or the
           complete "rendered result".  In many cases, the number list
           information is derived from a JPX number list (`nlst') box.
           However, it can also be derived by the containment of metadata
           within a JPX codestream header box or compositing layer header
           box.  The ensuing discussion assumes that the function returns
           true, meaning that the node is represented by a number list.
           [//]
           If this is an intermediate node, the number list is at least
           notionally the first sub-box of an association box, and all of
           the node's descendants (both immediate and indirect descendants)
           are deemed to be associated with each and every one of the image
           entities in the number list.
           [//]
           As mentioned above, it is also possible that an intermediate node
           is represented by a number list, without the appearance of an
           actual number list box within the JPX data source.  This happens
           if relevant metadata is encountered while parsing a JPX codestream
           header box or a JPX compositing layer header box.  In this case,
           a "virtual" number list is created, to refer to exactly one
           image entity -- the codestream or compositing layer, whose header
           generated the node.  The node's descendants then represent
           the metadata sub-boxes found within the relevant header.  It is
           important to realize that this kind of "virtual" number list
           can always be written into a JPX file as a real number list box
           within an association box, and indeed the JPX file writer always
           writes metadata in this way, rather than encapsulating it within
           header boxes.
           [//]
           If this node is a leaf, the number list corresponds to an
           isolated number list (`nlst') box, all by itself.  This is
           semantically less useful, of course, but still legal.
           [//]
           In addition to identifying whether or not the node is represented
           by a number list, this function also provides information
           concerning the number of codestreams and compositing layers which
           are referenced by the number list, and whether or not the
           number list references the complete "rendered result".
         [RETURNS]
           True only if the box is represented by a number list.
         [ARG: num_codestreams]
           Used to return the number of image entities in the number list
           which are codestreams.
         [ARG: num_layers]
           Used to return the number of image entities in the number list
           which are compositing layers.
         [ARG: applies_to_rendered_result]
           Used to return a boolean variable, which evaluates to true if the
           number list includes a reference to the complete "rendered result"
           of the JPX data source.  The variable is set to false if the number
           list contains references only to codestreams and/or compositing
           layers.  The actual meaning of the "rendered result" is unclear
           from the JPX specification, but it may refer to any of the
           results produced by applying the compositing instructions in a
           composition (`comp') box, if one is present.  Access to these
           compositing instructions is provided via the `jpx_composition'
           interface.

           THIS FUNCTION IS BEING DEPRECATED!
           It is not clear whether any application currently uses it, in
           preference to `get_numlist_info', `get_numlist_streams' and
           `get_numlist_layers'.  More significantly, the existence of
           this function suggests an interpretation of numlist associations
           as associations with image entities which satisfy codestream,
           compositing layer and rendered result constraints.  However, it
           is unclear from the JPX file format whether this is a correct
           interpretation.  If a numlist identifies codestreams and
           compositing layers, for example, association with that numlist
           should probably be considered an association with any image
           entity which satisfies any one of the codestream or compositing
           layer constraints.  Since the situation is not completely clear,
           and may be confused by this function, we prefer to mark the
           function as deprecated.  Avoid using it in new applications.

           This function provides a convenient (and potentially expandable)
           mechanism to identify semantic links between elements in the
           metanode hierarchy.  At present, any node satisfying all of the

           [>>] The node must be represented by a cross-reference box.
           [>>] The cross-reference box's fragment list must identify exactly
                one contiguous range of bytes from the same original file.
           [>>] The cross-reference box must point to the box associated with
                another node in the metanode hierarchy; for nodes with
                descendants, it may point either to the association box or
                to the node's immediate box, which is necessarily the first
                sub-box of its association box.  It is illegal for
                cross-reference boxes to point to other cross-reference boxes,
                but a link node might effectively reference another link node
                if that node has a containing asoc box.
           [//]
           If all the above conditions are satisfied, the function sets the
           `link_type' argument to one of `JPX_GROUPING_LINK',
           `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK' or `JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK', the
           interpretations of which are given below.  Otherwise, the function
           sets `link_type' to `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE' and returns an empty
           interface.
           [//]
           It is important to remember that when the ultimate source of data
           is a dynamic cache, the function may initially be unable to
           resolve a link, in which case it will set `link_type' to
           `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE' and return an empty interface. It is
           also possible that the link is able to be resolved, but its
           target node cannot yet be completely read.  In this case, the
           function sets `link_type' to the correct value but still returns
           an empty interface.  Both of these conditions may be transitory,
           meaning that subsequent calls to this function will return more
           complete information.  If any of these conditions change, the
           current node will be added to the list of touched nodes, from
           which it can be discovered using
           `jpx_meta_manager::get_touched_nodes'.
         [RETURNS]
           An empty interface if any of the following hold:
           [>>] The present node is not a cross-reference; or
           [>>] The present node is a cross-reference which cannot (at least
                for the moment) be resolved as a link to another node in the
                metadata hierarchy; or
           [>>] The present node is a link to another node in the metadata
                hierarchy, but the linked node cannot yet be completely
                read -- in this last case, `link_type' will be set to the
                correct link type, as opposed to `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE'.
         [ARG: link_type]
           Used to return one of the following link types, providing
           additional semantics, which are inferred by Kakadu based on
           reasonable assumptions concerning cross-referencing and the
           use of asoc boxes:
           [>>] `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE' -- the present node is not a
                cross-reference box or else the cross-reference cannot
                (at least for the moment) be resolved as a link to another
                node in the metadata hierarchy.
           [>>] `JPX_GROUPING_LINK' -- if the cross-reference box itself is
                the first sub-box of an `asoc' (association) box, Kakadu
                interprets it as a grouping link.  A grouping link serves to
                identify the remaining boxes in the `asoc' box as members of
                a group associated with the link target.  In the `jpx_metanode'
                hierarchy, these additional boxes are represented as the
                descendants of the link node.  If some of these descendants
                are themselves grouping links, their descendants belong to
                multiple groups.  Non-grouping links are necessarily leaves
                in the `jpx_metanode' tree hierarchy.  Grouping link nodes
                are particularly special because they can be the target of
                other links -- this is because the only way to arrange for
                a cross-reference box to refer to a link node is to refer to
                the node's containing `asoc' box (IS15444-2 makes it illegal
                for cross-references to point to other cross-reference boxes).
                If the target node of a grouping link is represented by the
                first sub-box of an `asoc' box, the grouping link points to
                this first sub-box, rather than the `asoc' box.  Evidently,
                grouping links may not point to other link nodes, since
                that would require the cross-reference box to reference
                another cross-reference box (illegal under IS15444-2).
                This also means that grouping links can accidentally cause
                true cycles to appear in the metadata structure -- no
                problem for Kakadu, but may be a problem for other file
                parsers which blindly expand cross-referenced contents.
           [>>] `JPX_ALTERNATE_CHILD_LINK' -- if the link node is a leaf
                (hence not a grouping link) and its cross-reference box
                points to an `asoc' box or to another leaf node (i.e., to any
                box which is not the first sub-box of an `asoc' box), the link
                target is interpreted as an alternate child of the link node's
                parent.  This interpretation agrees exactly with what would
                happen if the file parser transparently walked into the
                cross-reference box as though it were a local sub-box of
                the `asoc' box currently being parsed.  Note that alternate
                child links can legally point to other link nodes, so long
                as they are grouping links -- because the cross-reference
                box in this case points to an asoc box rather than another
                cross-reference box.
           [>>] `JPX_ALTERNATE_PARENT_LINK' - if the link node is a leaf
                (hence not a grouping link) and its cross-reference box
                points to the first sub-box of an `asoc' box, the link target
                is interpreted as an alternate parent of the link node's
                parent.  Where alternate parents exist, they are normally
                used to form bi-directional links between two nodes A and B,
                as follows: A(...Lc->B...) and B(...Lp->A...).  Here,
                A and B are each the first sub-box of their respective `asoc'
                boxes and parentheses are used to represent their descendants
                (non-initial sub-boxes of the asoc box); Lc->B is an
                alternate child link to node B (its cross-reference box points
                to B itself) and Lp->A is an alternate parent link to node A
                (is cross-reference box points to the `asoc' box headed by A).
                This arrangement allows A and B to discover each other with
                their proper relationships and should cause no problems for
                file readers which are not aware of Kakadu's interpretation.
                The arrangement is also very useful in JPIP browsing
                applications, since it forces a server to deliver A in any
                context where B must be expanded and vice-versa.  Evidently,
                alternate-parent links may not point to other link nodes,
                since that would require the cross-reference box to reference
                another cross-reference box (illegal under IS15444-2).

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This powerful function is intended to help you discover semantic
           connections between nodes within the metadata graph, by traversing
           parent/child links as well as the various types of inter-node
           links which can be discovered by `get_link' and `enum_linkers'.
           [//]
           The function tries to find a path emanating from the current node
           and terminating at the `target' node.  It is obvious that all
           nodes are ultimately connected by following an ascending path from
           the source node up to the root of the metanode hierarchy and then
           descending back down to the target node.  By contrast, the paths
           examined by the present function are those which involve a (possibly
           empty) descending portion, followed by a (possibly empty) ascending
           portion.
           [//]
           The descending portion passes through descendants, but
           can also follow alternate child links in the forward direction
           (using `get_link') or alternate parent links in the reverse
           direction (using `enum_linkers').
           [//]
           The ascending portion passes from children to parents, but can
           also follow alternate parent links in the forward direction
           (using `get_link') or alternate child links in the reverse
           direction (using `enum_linkers').
           [//]
           If you examine paths which involve descendants, parents and forward
           links only, you are discovering whether or not `target' is apparent
           from the current node.  If you examine paths which involve
           descendants, parents and reverse links only, you are discovering
           paths whether or not the current node is apparent from `target'.
           [//]
           Along the way, you can exclude paths which traverse links to
           certain types of nodes.  This is particularly interesting
           if you want to discover regions of interest or numlists which are
           related to a specific `target' while excluding paths which
           traverse links to direct descendants of other numlists or regions,
           making those descendants or numlists inherently more relevant
           to the `target'.  The exclusion arguments are irrelevant if the
           function is not configured to traverse links -- i.e., if neither
           `descending_flags' nor `ascending_flags' includes the
           `JPX_PATH_TO_FORWARD' or `JPX_PATH_TO_REVERSE' flags.
           [//]
           The function is robust, even if cycles are encountered in the
           graph created by links and descendant relationships. Paths in
           which such cycles are encountered are excluded.
           [//]
           However, the function can be expensive to execute
           if the current node is connected to numerous other nodes.  Thus,
           rather than executing the function with forward linking options
           from a heavily connected node to a less heavily connected target
           node, it is much better to execute it with reverse linking options
           from the less heavily connected node to the other one as target.
           The successful paths will be the same in both cases, but the
           execution cost much lower.
         [RETURNS]
           The function returns the first intermediate node in any path
           which it found from the current node to the `target' node by
           following the prescription established by the various arguments.
           By re-invoking the function on that node you can discover each
           successive node in a connecting path.  If no path was found, the
           function returns an empty interface.

           Box types used by exclusion rules -- see `exclusion_flags' for
           how these are used.
         [ARG: exclusion_flags]
           Controls the way in which each box type in `exclusion_box_types'
           is treated.  Each entry in the array is a logical OR of one or more

                traverses a link to a node which is descended from one with
                the associated box type.
         [ARG: unify_groups]
           If true, the function regards all nodes grouped together via
           grouping links (see the explanation of `JPX_GROUPING_LINK' under
           `get_link') as synonymous so long as `target' is one of these
           nodes.  That is, if `target' is a grouping link node, then any
           path which reaches the grouping link target or any other node
           which has the same grouping link target will be considered
           acceptable.  Any path which reaches a grouping link node
           which points to `target' is also considered acceptable.
           [//]
           Note that the `unify_groups' option is just a way of broadening the
           interpretation of the `target'; it does not represent the traversal
           of grouping links during the ascending or descending path phases.

           Use this function to add a descendant to the present node,
           assigning the descendant to represent a box whose type and
           contents are obtained by copying those of the `src' object.
           [//]
           Note carefully that `src' may be an interface to a different
           metadata tree.  Its contents might not be explicitly copied
           here; we might only preserve references.  As a result, you
           must make sure that the underlying `jp2_family_src' object,
           from which the contents of `src' might have been read, remains
           open until after the present box has been written using
           `jpx_target::write_metadata'.  However, it is safe to invoke
           `jpx_metanode::delete' on the `src' object after it has been
           copied.  This operation can be useful during editing operations.
           [//]
           If the `src' represents a link to some other object in its metadata
           tree (see `get_link') or is linked by some other object in
           its metadata tree, the behaviour depends on whether or not the
           current node belongs to the same metadata manager:
           [>>] If `src' belongs to a different metadata manager and contains
                links or is linked from elsewhere, the copying process
                attempts to reproduce these links.  Specifically, a copied
                link attempts to resolve itself with a copy of the object
                that `src' was linked to.  If it cannot do so immediately,
                internal machinery is set up to make sure that the copied link
                will resolve itself to a copy of the object to which `src'
                was linked if and when such a copy becomes available in the
                future.  Until such resolution takes place, the copied
                object's `jpx_metanode::get_link' function will returns an
                empty interface, although `jpx_metanode::get_box_type' will
                identify the copied object as a cross-reference box
                (`jp2_cross_reference_4cc').
           [>>] If `src' is a link and it belongs to the same metadata
                manager as the link being copied, the copied object will be
                a link to the same `jpx_metanode' as `src'.  However, if the
                `link_to_internal_copies' argument is true, the behaviour
                described above, for different metadata managers, is
                reproduced.
         [RETURNS]
           This function may possibly return an empty interface, if no copy
           of the node was actually added.  This happens if you attempt to
           copy a cross-reference node (see `get_cross_reference') which does
           not link to another known node (see `get_link').  It also happens
           if you attempt to copy a link node (in the sense of `get_link')
           whose link target has been deleted.
         [ARG: recursive]
           If true, the `src' node's descendants will be copied recursively.
           While doing so, the function will attempt to parse as many of
           the descendant boxes as possible -- if the source is fuelled
           ultimately by a dynamic cache, the descendants of an available
           node may grow, as more data arrives from a remote server.
         [ARG: link_to_internal_copies]
           This argument affects the behaviour only when `src' has the same
           metadata manager as the current object and `src' is a link (i.e.,
           `src.get_link' returns a non-empty interface).  In this case,
           the default policy is to create a new link which points back to
           the same metanode as `src'.  However, if this argument is true,
           the behaviour is to link the new metanode to the most recent
           copy of the link target, or to leave the link unresolved until such
           a copy becomes available.
           [//]
           This creates a powerful mechanism for duplicating complex
           metadata graphs during editing operations.  However, if a given
           collection of metadata is copied multiple times, links may
           accidentally be formed to unintended copies; this can happen if
           a previously copied metanode has not yet had an opportunity to be
           recopied by the time a link to the copy needs to be resolved.
           [//]
           To avoid the potential pitfalls described above, you are strongly
           advised to invoke the `jpx_meta_manager::reset_copy_locators'
           function before copying metadata wtihin the same metadata manager
           with the `link_to_internal_copies' argument set to true.
           [//]
           After copying a partial collection of metanodes from the
           metadata hierarchy with `link_to_internal_copies' set to true,
           it is possible that some link metanodes remain unresolved --
           because their targets were never copied.  The caller may wish to
           make a subsequent sweep through the copied metadata setting any
           such unresolved links to point back to their original source --
           usually the best practice during editing operations.

           [//]
           Note that the touched list only ever contains metanodes whose
           underlying box is complete.  When reading from a dynamic cache,
           a box may have been encountered, but its contents not yet fully

           happens, the box's metanode is created and made available, but
           it is not added to the touched list until the box has been
           completely read.  Touching metanodes like this will not have
           any effect.  Also, a metanode whose box has not yet been read
           will not yet have any available descendants, so no descendants
           can be touched either, even if their underlying boxes are

          metadata for the current node and/or its descendants.
          [//]
          It is easiest to understand the function if we first ignore any

          the purpose of the function is to issue the metadata requests
          required to determine the number of descendants, the box-type of
          each descendant, and the contents of each immediate descendant
          whose box-type matches one of the `num_box_types_of_interest'
          types in the `box_types_of_interest' array.  In the special case
          where `num_box_types_of_interest' is 0, the caller is assumed to be
          interested in all box-types.  In the event that one of the boxes of
          interest is a cross-reference box, the function issues a request
          for the box even if its contents are fully available, if the target
          location of the cross-reference cannot yet be resolved to a JPIP
          data-bin; this is because JPIP servers are obliged to send both
          the cross-reference and sufficient box headers to locate the
          reference target.
          [//]
          Note that the function only issues metadata requests sufficient to
          recover the immediate descendants of the current node, with one
          of the box-types of interest.  It is possible that the request must
          be generated in a manner which encompasses more data than required.
          It is also possible that the server will send more data than required
          even if the request is very tight.  Nevertheless, the intent is to
          generate requests which recover the box contents of all relevant
          child nodes, not including their own descendants (if they have any).
          [//]
          An additional powerful feature of this function is the ability to
          descend into a defined subset of the node's children, recursively
          re-applying itself to each such descendant which is available.  The
          `num_descend_box_types' and `descend_box_types' members are used to
          specify the box-types of the boxes you are interested in visiting
          during this recursive process.  We do not currently provide any
          means of stating that you wish to recursively descend into all
          children, regardless of box-type, partly because this might be
          reckless.
          [//]
          Note that this function may request metadata which is already
          available, since it does not automatically parse any new data
          which may have arrived in the cache.  As a general rule, you
          should use this function in conjunction with
          `jpx_meta_manager::load_matches'.
        [RETURNS]
          The number of distinct calls to `client_window->metareq' which were
          generated by the function.  This value might be 0 if all relevant
          descendants are available already. The function takes advantage
          of internal state information to rapidly dismiss nodes whose
          descendants are already fully available.

          Object whose `kdu_window::add_metareq' function is used to add
          metadata requests for the relevant entities.
        [ARG: num_box_types_of_interest]
          Number of elements in the `box_types_of_interest' array.  If zero,
          the caller is interested in all box-types -- this is represented
          by a `box_type' value of 0 in calls to `kdu_window::add_metareq'.
          Otherwise, you should try to keep the list short, to minimize the
          cost of transmitting metadata requests.
        [ARG: box_types_of_interest]
          Array of box types which are of interest to the caller; may be NULL
          if `num_box_types_of_interest' is 0 or negative.
        [ARG: num_descend_box_types]
          If 0, the function does not recursively descend into children.
          Otherwise, this argument specifies the number of box-types provided
          by the `descend_box_types' array.
        [ARG: descend_box_types]
          Array of box-types, one of which must be matched by any child into
          which this function recursively descends and re-applies itself.
          These box-types need not necessarily be included in the list
          supplied by `box_types_of_interest', but most useful applications
          of the function probably involve `box_types_of_interest' being a
          superset of `descend_box_types'.
        [ARG: priority]

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Similar to `generate_metareq' but used to recover information
           associated with the target of a link node (see `get_link').
           [//]
           If `get_link' reports a `jpx_metanode_link_type' value of
           `JPX_METANODE_LINK_NONE', the current node is not a link node (or
           at least we are not able to discover whether or not it is a link
           node yet) and so the function does nothing.
           [//]
           In the first instance, the function generates sufficient
           metadata requests to obtain the information required for
           `get_link' to return a non-empty target node, unless the target
           of the link is known to have a box-type which is not one of the
           box types of interest (see `num_box_types_of_interest' and
           `box_types_of_interest').
           [//]
           If `num_descend_box_types' > 0 and the link target's box-type can
           be determined to match both one of the required box types and
           one of the box types in the `descend_box_types' array, the
           function effectively applies `generate_metareq' to the link target,
           passing all of its arguments through to their namesakes in that
           function.
         [RETURNS]
           The number of calls to `client_window->add_metareq' issued by the
           function.  If the function returns 0 and `get_link' continues to
           return an empty interface, the function must have discovered that
           the target of the link has a box-type other than one of those
           given by `num_box_types_of_interest' and `box_types_of_interest' --
           it might be able to discover this without actually having sufficient
           data in the caching source to read the contents of the target node's
           primary box.

           Object whose `kdu_window::add_metareq' function is used to add
           metadata requests for the relevant entities.
         [ARG: num_box_types_of_interest]
           Number of elements in the `box_types_of_interest' array.  If zero,
           the caller is interested in all box-types.
         [ARG: box_types_of_interest]
           Array of box types which are of interest to the caller.  If the
           target of any link represented by the current node is known to
           have a box-type which differs from all of these box-types
           (and `num_box_types_of_interest' > 0), the function does not do
           anything.  This argument may be NULL if `num_box_types_of_interest'
           is 0.
         [ARG: num_descend_box_types]

class jpx_meta_manager {
  /* [BIND:interface]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       This object provides access to the metadata tree managed by the
       `jpx_metanode' interface.  For a thorough discussion of the structure
       and contents of metadata trees, refer to the extensive comments
       appearing with `jpx_metanode'.  You should review these concepts before
       trying to understand the ensuing text.  For more information on the
       exact box types which are represented by the metadata tree, see
       the `set_box_filter' function.
       [//]
       In addition to granting access to the metadata tree, the present
       object adds an additional layer of organization on the metadata,
       providing efficient access to boxes of interest and
       facilitating the creation of files whose metadata organization is
       amenable to efficient access in remote client-server applications.
       [//]
       This additional layer of organization consists of a number of
       linked lists.  Each node in the metadata tree may reside on at
       most one of these lists, although some nodes might not reside on
       any list.  These lists are not apparent to the application, but it
       is worth offering some explanation here so that you can appreciate
       what is going on.  The lists may be divided into three types,
       as described below.
       [//]
       A first type of list serves to link metadata nodes which are
       represented by an ROI description box.  This includes leaf nodes
       which contain an ROI description box, as well as intermediate nodes
       whose association box's first sub-box is an ROI description box.
       The common feature of all these nodes is that the corresponding
       `jpx_metanode::get_num_regions' function returns a non-zero number
       of image regions.
       [//]
       There may be many lists of this first type, which are managed
       using a scale-space structure.  The multi-scale aspects of the
       structure are generated by dividing the relevant nodes, i, on
       the basis of a dimension D_i.  D_i is the largest dimension of
       the smallest bounding box which contains all regions in the ROI
       description box.
         [>>] The multi-scale structure is based on a collection of thresholds,
              T0=0 < T1 < T2 < ... If D_i lies in the range T(k-1) < D_i <= Tk,
              then node i is associated with scale k.  The value of T1 is
              currently fixed at 8, but there is no need for the
              application ever to know what this value is and it might
              easily change in the future.
         [>>] Associated with each scale k, is a spatial partition whose
              dimensions are proportional to the scale threshold, Tk.
              Each element in the partition has its own list, into which the
              nodes whose upper left hand corner lies within that partition
              are inserted.
         [>>] To further improve access efficiency, the lists within each
              scale are further arranged into an hierarchical structure.
       [//]
       The second type of list serves to link all metadata nodes which are
       represented by a number list.  This includes leaf nodes which
       contain a number list box, intermediate nodes corresponding to
       association boxes whose first sub-box is a number list box, and
       intermediate nodes which serve to collect metadata found inside
       codestream or compositing layer header boxes.  The common feature
       of all these nodes is that the corresponding
       `jpx_metanode::get_numlist_info' function returns true.  There
       is currently exactly one of these lists.
       [//]
       A third type of list manages all nodes are not linked into or
       descended from any node which is linked into either of the list
       types mentioned above.  These nodes represent metadata which is
       not associated with any specific image entity or image region.
       Such metadata may be considered to describe properties of the
       file itself, rather than its imagery.  We do not expect to encounter
       too much of this type of metadata, so only one list is used.
       [//]
       Note that any node which is associated with a number list and/or
       an ROI description box, but which is not itself a number list or
       ROI description, will not be linked into any of the lists.
       [//]
       The lists described above have no impact on the way
       the metadata tree actually appears.  They serve only to improve
       the efficiency with which searches are made for metadata associated
       with a specific image region or image entity.  The relevant searches
       are facilitated by the `enumerate_matches' function.
       [//]
       The lists are also used when writing metadata to a JPX file.  The
       idea is that if the lists tend to improve the efficiency with which
       a file's metadata tree can be searched, then organizing the metadata
       within each list into a separate top level group of boxes in the
       file will also be beneficial. In particular, this will help reduce
       the number of top level boxes whose contents need to be expanded
       by a JPIP server when delivering metadata to a client -- each
       such box will typically be represented by a JPIP placeholder box.
       [//]
       It is worth knowing that Kakadu's JPX file writer builds these top
       level groupings by creating association boxes whose first sub-box
       is a free box.  Since the contents of a placeholder are associated
       only with the first sub-box, and that box has no semantics, this
       mechanism serves to create groups without any unintended semantic
       overtones.
       [//]
       It is also worth knowing that some nodes in the metadata tree may
       have descendants which reside on different lists and hence are
       included in different top level groups by the Kakadu JPX file
       writer.  Where this happens, the common boxes must be duplicated,
       either explicitly or by reference, which may create some redundancy
       in the file.
       [//]
       Note carefully that objects of the `jpx_meta_manager' class are merely
       interfaces to an internal object, which cannot be directly created
       by an application.  Use `jpx_target::access_meta_manager' or
       `jpx_source::access_meta_manager' to obtain a non-empty interface.

           This function may be used to control the box types which are
           included in the metadata tree as a JPX data source is being
           parsed.  By default, the following box types are included:

           In addition, all association (`asoc') boxes, and the first
           sub-box of every association box, are automatically included.
           [//]
           You may change the default set of boxes listed above by providing
           an array of box types to be included.  Note that association boxes
           and their first sub-boxes are always included, regardless of the
           supplied filter.  Apart from this, boxes which do not match the
           filter and which are not otherwise required for rendering imagery,
           will be discarded.  The following box types are currently
           considered to be required for rendering imagery; including them
           in a box filter list will have no effect:
           [>>] JP2 signature (`jP  ');

              will be appended to the internal list of touched nodes.  Of
              course, its descendants will also be deleted and appended to
              the list.  Remember that deleted nodes are not physically
              deleted from memory; one good reason for this is to enable
              applications to track such deletions via the present function.
         [>>] If a node's ancestry is changed by `jpx_metanode::change_parent'
              the node and all of its descencants will be marked as having a
              changed ancestry and appended to the list of touched nodes.
         [>>] If a node's data is changed by `jpx_metanode::change_to_label'
              or `jpx_metanode::change_to_delayed', the node will be
              appended to the list of touched nodes and all of its
              descendants will be marked as having a changed ancestry and
              also appended.
         [>>] If `jpx_metanode::touch' is invoked, the node and all of its
              descedants will be appended to the list of touched nodes.
         [//]
         Noting that all of the above conditions also cause a node's descendants
         to be recursively appended to the list, we are able to guarantee that
         any node which experiences any of these conditions will always appear
         on the touched list prior to the point at which its descendants, if any,
         appear on the list.  This can simplify some applications of the function.
         [//]
         The following two conditions can also result in a node appearing on the
         touched list.  These conditions do not relate to changes in the state of
         the node itself, but rather changes in the ability to recover descendants
         of the node.  If a node appears on the touched list for one of these
         reasons and no other reason, it is possible that its descendants appear
         at an earlier location within the touched list -- it is not expected that
         this should complicate applications of the function.  The two conditions
         given below are relevant only in the case where the ultimate source of
         data is a dynamic cache, whose contents may grow in unexpected ways.
         [>>] If the number of descendants associated with a node becomes known
              where it was not known before (see `jpx_metanode::count_descendants')
              the node will appear somewhere in the internal list of touched nodes;
              it is only guaranteed to appear prior to its descendants if it has
              also changed in one of the ways described above, or recently become
              available for the first time.
         [>>] If any immediate descendant of a node becomes available via
              `jpx_metanode::get_descendant' where it was not previously available,
              the node will appear somewhere in the internal list of touched nodes;
              it is only guaranteed to appear prior to its descendants if it has
              also changed in one of the ways described above, or recently
              become available for the first time.
         [//]
         This function is provided to facilitate efficient updating of
         application-defined structures as metadata becomes available
         (e.g., from a dynamic cache) or as metadata is edited.
         [//]
         To find out what changes actually occurred, you can use the
         functions `jpx_metanode::is_changed', `jpx_metanode::is_deleted'
         and `jpx_metanode::ancestor_changed'.  All of these functions may
         return false if the node is newly parsed from a data source or
         otherwise created, or if the node found its way onto the touched
         node list as a result of a call to `jpx_metanode::touch'.
         [//]
         One feature of this function is that metanodes which are freshly
         created as a result of parsing an input file are not considered to
         be touched until their principle box has been completely parsed
         (this is the first sub-box of an association box, or else it is
         the sole box associated with the metanode).  This means that every
         metanode you find on the touched list is available in full, except
         that its descendants, if any, might not yet all be available.  Once
         they become available, they too will be added to the touched list.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           It is good practice to call this function prior to
           `jpx_metanode::add_copy' if you are planning to supply a true
           value for that function's `link_to_internal_copies' argument --
           note that this is not the default.
           [//]
           The function erases all internal records of copies which have been
           made to the `src' object and (if `recursive' is true) to all of
           its descendants.  You invoke the function on the `src' node/s
           that you intend to copy, from the `jpx_meta_manager' into which
           you intend to make the copy.  The internal copy locators kept by
           the target `jpx_meta_manager' are used to resolve links within
           the source of the copy to point to copies of original link target
           where possible -- this behaviour is automatic when copying between
           different metadata managers, but requires `add_copy' to be given
           `link_to_internal_copies'=true when copying within a single
           metadata manager.  The first time you make such a copy there
           is no need to call the present function.  However, if you make a
           second copy between the same pair of metadata managers (or a
           second copy within the same metadata manager), this function should
           be invoked first to ensure that links resolve to the correct
           copy generation.
           [//]
           It is usually simplest and safest to invoke this function with
           `src' set to the root of the source metadata hierarchy and
           `recursive' set to true.
         [ARG: recursive]
           If true, the function recursively passes through all descendants
           of the `src' node.
         [ARG: fixup_unresolved_links]
           If true, the function examines unresolved links which were left
           over from a previous copy process.  Unresolved links are copied
           link nodes (nodes for which `jpx_metanode::get_link' returns
           a non-empty interface) which were generated by
           `jpx_metanode::add_copy' with `link_to_internal_copies'=true,
           but for which no copy of the original link target has yet been
           encountered.  If `fixup_unresolved_links' is true and an
           unresolved link is discovered, the link is set to point back to
           the original target of the copy operation -- of course, this is
           not done if `src' belongs to a different metadata manager to the
           copied link which needs resolving, since links cannot point
           into the metadata hierarchy of a separate JPX source/target.  This
           fixup procedure is a very convenient way to conclude any large
           scale copying operation within a complex metadata graph.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function represents the metadata search facilities of the

           If `last_node' is not an empty interface, the function searches
           for the first node which follows the `last_node' and satisfies
           the conditions.  For reliable behaviour, any non-empty `last_node'
           interface should refer to a node which itself matches the
           conditions.
           [//]
           You should be aware that the order in which this function
           enumerates the matching nodes is not generally predictable.
           In fact, the order may potentially change each time you invoke
           the `load_matches' function.  In particular, if the file is located
           on a remote server, delivered via JPIP, you may need to call
           `load_matches' frequently, and after each call the only way
           to enumerate all metadata which matches some criterion is to
           start from scratch, calling this function first with an empty
           `last_node' interface and then until it returns an empty
           interface.
           [//]
           To understand the constraints imposed by the various arguments
           it is convenient to define three types of nodes:
             [>>] "ROI Nodes" are those whose `jpx_metanode::get_num_regions'
                  function returns non-zero.  These are also exactly the
                  nodes which are found within the first type of internal
                  list described in the introduction to the `jpx_meta_manager'
                  object.
             [>>] "Numlist Nodes" are those whose
                  `jpx_metanode::get_numlist_info' function returns true.
                  These are also exactly the nodes which are found within
                  the second type of internal list described in the
                  introduction to the `jpx_meta_manager' object.
             [>>] "Unassociated Nodes" are those which do not satisfy
                  either of the criteria above AND are not descended from
                  any node which does.  These are exactly the nodes which
                  are found within the third type of internal list
                  described in the introduction to the `jpx_meta_manager'
                  object.
           [//]
           The function matches only those nodes which belong to one of
           the above three categories.  It matches "ROI Nodes" if and only
           if `region' is a non-empty region.  It matches "Numlist Nodes"
           if and only if `region' is an empty region and either
           `codestream_idx'>=0, `compositing_layer_idx'>=0 or
           `applies_to_rendered_result'=true.  It matches "Unassociated Nodes"
           if and only if `codestream_idx'=-1, `compositing_layer_idx'=-1,
           `applies_to_rendered_result'=false, and `region' is an empty
           region.
           [//]
           In some cases, the application may be interested in finding
           "Numlist Nodes" which contain metadata associated with the
           entities in the number list, but not with a specific ROI.  To
           facilitate this, the `exclude_region_numlists' argument may be
           set to true (see below).
         [RETURNS]
           An empty interface if no match can be found.
         [ARG: codestream_idx]
           If non-negative, the function matches "Numlist Nodes" which
           reference the indicated codestream index or
           "ROI Nodes" which have a "Numlist Node" in their ancestry which
           references the indicated codestream index.  The latter case
           applies only if `region' is non-empty.
         [ARG: compositing_layer_idx]
           If non-negative, the function matches "Numlist Nodes" which
           reference the indicated compositing layer index or
           "ROI Nodes" which have a "Numlist Node" in their ancestry which
           is compatible with the compositing layer index.  The latter case
           applies only if `region' is non-empty.
         [ARG: applies_to_rendered_result]
           If true, the function matches "Numlist Nodes" which
           reference the "rendered result" or "ROI Nodes" which have a
           "Numlist Node" in their ancestry which references the "rendered
           result".  The latter case applies only if `region' is non-empty.
         [ARG: region]
           If non-empty, the function matches only "ROI Nodes" whose
           bounding box intersects with the supplied region.  Note that this
           does not necessarily mean that any of the individual regions in
           the ROI description box will intersect with `region', although
           it usually does mean this.  See `jpx_metanode::get_bounding_box'
           for more on the bounding box.
         [ARG: min_size]
           Ignored unless `region' is a non-empty region.  In this case,
           the function matches only "ROI Nodes" which contain at least
           one region, whose width is no smaller than `min_size', as measured
           by `jpx_roi::measure_span'.  As discussed in connection with that
           function, the width of simple rectangles and ellipses is simply
           the smaller of their two dimensions, while the width of general
           quadrilaterals is measured as the width of the narrowest rectangle
           which encloses the quadrilateral and is aligned with at least
           one side parallel to one of the quadrilateral edges.
           [//]
           This argument facilitates the efficient deployment of
           resolution sensitive metadata browsing systems.  An interactive
           image browser, for example, may choose not to generate overlay
           information for spatially-sensitive metadata whose spatial
           dimensions are too small to be clearly discerned at the current
           viewing resolution.  For example, streets might only become
           apparent on an image of a metropolitan area at some sufficiently
           fine level of image detail.  Cluttering the image with metadata
           holding the street names before the streets can be clearly
           discerned would be inadvisable (and computationally inefficient).
         [ARG: exclude_region_numlists]
           If true, the function will skip over any "Numlist Nodes" whose
           only immediate descendants are "ROI Nodes".  The argument is
           relevant only if `region' is empty and either
           `codestream_idx' >= 0, `compositing_layer_idx' >= 0 or
           `applies_to_rendered_result' is true.
         [ARG: ignore_missing_numlist_categories]
           If false, all of the conditions associated with any non-negative
           `codestream_idx', `compositing_layer_idx' arguments must be true.
           Otherwise, it is sufficient to match numlists which satisfy any
           one of the conditions if no information is provided for the other.
           That is, it is sufficient to find a numlist which matches
           `codestream_idx' if it specifies no compositing layer indices;
           similarly, it is sufficient to find a numlist which matches
           `compositing_layer_idx' if it specifies no codestream indices.

           If necessary, the function creates new entries in the metadata
           tree to hold a number list representing the image entities
           specified via the first five arguments and the image regions
           specified via the last two arguments, returning a reference to
           the relevant node.
           [//]
           If `num_regions' is 0, the returned node lies in a context which
           does not associated it with any image region.  Otherwise, there
           must be at least one codestream specified, since ROI description
           boxes are meaningless unless associated with codestreams.  If
           `num_regions' is non-zero, the function always creates a new
           ROI description node, even if an identical one already exists
           with the same image entity associations.  This saves us the
           overhead of tracking down unlikely events.
           [//]
           If `num_codestreams' and `num_compositing_layers' are 0 and
           `applies_to_rendered_result' is false, the returned node lies
           in a context which does not associate it with any number list.
           [//]
           If both of the above sets of conditions apply, the function simply
           returns the root of the metadata tree.
         [ARG: num_codestreams]
           Number of codestreams with which the returned node must be
           associated.  It should be associated with no more and no
           fewer.
         [ARG: codestream_indices]
           Array with `num_codestreams' entries containing the indices
           of the codestreams with which the returned node must be
           associated.  All indices start from 0, which represents the
           first codestream in the file.
         [ARG: num_compositing_layers]
           Number of compositing layers with which the returned node must be
           associated.  It should be associated with no more and no
           fewer.
         [ARG: layer_indices]
           Array with `num_compositing_layers' entries containing the indices
           of the compositing layers with which the returned node must be
           associated.  All indices start from 0, which represents the
           first compositing layer in the file.
         [ARG: applies_to_rendered_result]
           True if the returned node is to be associated with the "rendered
           result"; otherwise it is not to be associated with the rendered
           result.
         [ARG: num_regions]
           Number of elements in the `regions' array.  If this is non-zero,
           the `num_codestreams' argument must also be non-zero, since 
           the contents of an ROI description box are meaningful primarily
           when its regions are associated with some code-stream.  In the
           future, we may remove this restriction, since the JPX file format
           does allow for the possibility of unassociated ROI description
           boxes, which are interpreted as belonging to the rendered result.
           For the purpose of creating JPX metadata from scratch, however,
           it is unlikely that any flexibility is sacrificed by forcing the
           application to describe regions with respect to a codestream
           coordinate system.
           [//]
           If this argument is zero, the returned node is not to be
           associated with any image regions through ROI description boxes.
         [ARG: regions]
           Array with `num_regions' entries, holding the collection of
           image regions which are to be recorded in an ROI description
           box with which the returned node is to be associated.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function is able to open both JP2 and JPX compatible data
           sources.  Note that the most correct suffix to use for JPX files
           is actually ".jpf", not ".jpx", although the latter is not an
           unreasonable choice.  If the data source is not compatible with
           either the JPX or JP2 specifications, an error will be generated
           through `kdu_error', unless `return_if_incompatible' is true.
           [//]
           It is illegal to invoke this function on an object which has
           previously been opened, but not yet closed.
         [RETURNS]
           Three possible values, as follows:
           [>>] 0 if insufficient information is available from the `src'
                object to complete the opening operation.  In practice,
                this can occur only if the `src' object is fueled by a
                dynamic cache (a `kdu_cache' object).  In order to complete
                the opening of a JP2 data source, the signature and file-type
                boxes must both be found.  In order to complete the opening
                of a JPX file, the reader requirements box must also be
                found or else it must be discovered to be missing (some
                earlier JPX writers did not generate the JPX box, even though
                it is formally required), but we can tell if it is missing
                pretty easily, since it is required to follow the file-type
                box.
           [>>] 1 if successful.
           [>>] -1 if the data source is found not to be compatible with the
                JPX or JP2 specifications on the basis of the signature or
                file-type boxes (or their absence).  This value will not
                be returned unless `return_if_incompatible' is true (see
                below).  If it is returned, the object will be left in the
                closed state.
         [ARG: src]
           The `jp2_family_src' object must already have been opened.  It
           should generally support seeking, since non-seekable sources will
           cause errors to be generated unless the `jpx_source' is used
           in a manner which is consistent with linearly reading the
           data sources from beginning to end -- such use is possible for
           appropriately organized files.
           [//]
           NOTE CAREFULLY: if your application needs to perform multi-threaded
           decompression while simultaneously using the services offered by
           the present object to dynamically load metadata or structural
           information from `src' -- this would definitely happen, for
           example, in interactive applications where the ultimate source
           of data is a dynamic cache (see `kdu_cache') -- then you need
           to make sure that the `src->acquire_lock' and
           `src->release_lock' functions actually do provide mutually
           exclusive locking functionality.  That is, you need to provide a
           derived version of `jp2_family_src' here, which implements those
           functions.  The `jp2_threadsafe_family_src' class should fit the
           bill.
         [ARG: return_if_incompatible]
           If false, an error will be generated through `kdu_error' if the
           data source is found to be incompatible with either the JPX or JP2
           specifications.  If true, incompatibility will not generate an
           error, but the function will return -1, leaving the application
           free to pass the `src' object to another file format reader
           (unless the `src' is not seekable, in which case it must be closed
           and re-opened before trying a different file format reader).

           If the number of codestreams in the JPX/JP2 data source is already
           known, this function returns true, writing that number into `count'.
           Otherwise, the function attempts to parse further into the data
           source in order to count the number of codestreams which are
           available.  If it encounters the end of the source, or is otherwise
           able to deduce that the number of codestreams is known, it again
           returns true, writing the number of codestreams into `count'.
           [//]
           If the function is unable to parse to a point at which the number
           of codestreams can be known, it returns false, writing the
           number of codestreams encountered up to that point into the
           `count' argument.
           [//]
           A codestream is considered to have been encountered once either
           its codestream header box is encountered or its contiguous
           codestream (jp2c) or fragment table (ftbl) box has been
           encountered.  To actually access the codestream via the
           `access_codestream' function, more information is generally
           required.  In particular, the codestream's main header must be
           available, and either its codestream header box must have been
           encountered, or the reader must be able to deduce that there will
           be none (normally, this can only be deduced once the end of the
           file has been encountered, so JPX writers are strongly advised
           to include codestream header boxes).  However, these conditions
           need not all be met for the codestream's existence to be
           determined by the present function.
         [RETURNS]
           False if it is possible that more codestreams remain in the
           data source, but the function is unable to parse any further
           into the source at this point.  This generally means that the
           underlying `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache
           (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).
      */
    KDU_AUX_EXPORT bool count_compositing_layers(int &count);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function plays a similar role to `count_codestreams' but
           counts the number of compositing layers instead.  If the data
           source contains compositing layer header (jplh) boxes,
           the function counts the number of such boxes.  If it contains no
           compositing layer header boxes, the function returns 1, treating
           the first codestream as a compositing layer and using the
           JP2 header to derive colour space and other information which
           would normally appear within a compositing layer header box.
           [//]
           In either case, the function returns true, unless it cannot be
           sure what the count is, because insufficient elements from the data
           source are currently available.  This generally means that the
           underlying `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache
           (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).
           [//]
           When the number of compositing layers cannot yet be determined,
           the function writes the number of compositing layer header boxes
           found so far into the `count' argument.  This may be 0 if the
           data source contains no compositing layer header boxes and the
           end of the source has not yet been encountered.
           [//]
           JPX data sources need not necessarily contain compositing layer
           header boxes; in this case, each codestream represents a separate
           compositing layer.  However, the reader cannot make this judgement
           until the end of the file has been encountered.  If the data
           source is ultimately fueled by a dynamic cache whose top-level
           databin is incomplete, the function may thus have to return with
           `count' equal to 0, even if a large number of codestreams have
           been encountered already.  For these reasons, JPX writers are
           strongly encouraged to include compositing layer header boxes,
           even if they are not strictly required.
        [RETURNS]
           False if the number of compositing layers cannot yet be
           determined, because the function is unable to parse any further
           into the source at this point.  This generally means that the
           underlying `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache
           (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jpx_codestream_source
      access_codestream(int which, bool need_main_header=true);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Provides access to the codestream identified by `which'.  If
           `which' is 0, this is the first codestream in the data source; if
           `which' is 1, it is the second codestream in the data source, and
           so forth.
           [//]
           If the function is unable to access the requested codestream at
           present, it returns an empty interface (one whose
           `jpx_codestream_source::exists' function returns false).  This may
           happen either because the total number of codestreams in the
           data source is less than or equal to `which', or because the
           function is not yet able to parse far enough into the data source
           to recover the relevant boxes along with the code-stream's main
           header (if `need_main_header' is true).  The latter conditions
           can occur only if the underlying `jp2_family_src' objct is fueled
           by a dynamic cache (i.e., a `kdu_cache' object).
           [//]
           Before this function will return a non-empty interface, it must
           have encountered the contiguous codestream (jp2c) or fragment
           table (ftbl) box which holds the codestream's contents.  For
           data sources which are fueled by a dynamic cache, the entire
           main header must also be available already, unless
           `need_main_header' is false, in which case the
           `jpx_codestream_source::stream_ready' interface can be used to
           determine the point at which the main header is available.  If
           the codestream is represented by a fragment table box, however,
           it is not possible to check for main header availability, so the
           `need_main_header' argument is ignored.  The object must also
           have either seen all top level box headers in the data source,
           or have encountered both the JP2 header (jp2h) box
           and the relevant codestream header (chdr) box.
           [//]
           In other words, the function will not return a non-empty interface
           until it can be sure that all relevant information has been parsed
           from the data source and the codestream box itself can at least
           be successfully opened using `jpx_codestream_source::open_stream'.
           These conditions are more stringent than those required to count
           codestreams, so that `which' may be much less than the number
           returned by `count_codestreams', yet this function still returns
           an empty interface.  This just means that the underlying dynamic
           cache must receive more data before the codestream can be
           accessed.
         [ARG: need_main_header]
           If true, the `kdu_codestream_source::stream_ready' function
           of any non-empty returned interface will always return true.

    KDU_AUX_EXPORT jpx_layer_source
      access_layer(int which, bool need_stream_headers=true);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Similar to `access_codestream' but accesses the information
           associated with the compositing layer identified by `which'.  If
           `which' is 0, this is the first compositing layer in the data
           source; if `which' is 1, the second compositing layer is being
           requested, and so forth.  All data sources managed by this object
           are deemed to have at least one compositing layer, even if they
           do not contain explicit compositing layer header boxes.  Even a
           basic JP2 file always has one compositing layer and one codestream.
           If the data source contains compositing layer header boxes, there
           is one compositing layer for each such header box.  Otherwise
           (and this can only be determined by parsing to the end of the
           file first), each codestream corresponds to a separate compositing
           layer.

           If the function is unable to access the requested layer at present,
           it returns an empty interface (one whose `jpx_layer_source::exists'
           function returns false).  This may happen either because the
           total number of compositing layers in the data source is less than
           or equal to `which', or because the function is not yet able to
           parse far enough into the data source to recover the relevant
           boxes.  The latter generally occurs only if the underlying
           `jp2_family_src' object is fueled by a dynamic cache (i.e., a
           `kdu_cache' object).
           [//]
           Before the function will return a non-empty interface, it must
           have found and parsed the compositing layer header (jplh) box, if
           any, in addition to any JP2 header (jp2h) box which is required
           for recovering default parameters, and any codestream header
           box whose component mapping box might be required to interpret
           channel mapping rules.  Alternatively, we must have reached the
           end of the data source or have other means of knowing that there
           will be no compositing layer header box for this layer.
           These complexities arise because JPX was created to allow quite
           a bit of flexibility for writers, but this has obvious adverse
           implications for readers, leaving them unable to make solid
           incremental decisions often until all boxes have been seen.  The
           Kakadu implementation does its best to hide all such irregularities
           from the application.

           For each required codestream, the embedded codestream box must
           also be available before a non-empty interface will be returned.

           headers associated with the required codestreams must also be
           available.

  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       Provides full support for generating or copying JPX files.
       Note that the most correct suffix to use for JPX files is actually
       ".jpf", not ".jpx", although the latter is still a reasonable choice. 
       The typical sequence of operations used to generate a JPX file is
       as follows:
       [>>] Create and open a `jp2_family_tgt' object.
       [>>] Pass this object to `jpx_target::open'.
       [>>] Add at least one codestream using `jpx_target::add_codestream' and
            at least one composition layer using `jpx_target::add_layer'.
       [>>] Configure the various parameters of the `jpx_codestream_target'
            and `jpx_layer_target' interfaces returned via the above-mentioned
            functions.
       [>>] Call `write_headers' to write the JPX file header and as many
            of the compositing layer and codestream header boxes as you
            like.  If you have installed breakpoints using
            `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint'
            or `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint', you must call
            `write_headers' multiple times, writing additional boxes of your
            choice after each breakpoint.
       [>>] Optionally write additional boxes after `write_headers' returns
            NULL.
       [>>] Pass through each `jpx_codestream_target' interface in turn,
            using its `jpx_codestream_target::open_stream' function to open a
            contiguous codestream box.  Pass this box directly to 
            `kdu_codestream::create' and generate the codestream using
            `kdu_codestream::flush'.  Alternatively, you may write directly to
            the open box (e.g., to copy a code-stream, or write a non-JPEG2000
            codestream).  As a final alternative, you may use
            `jpx_codestream_target::write_fragment_table' to write a fragment
            table box in place of a contiguous codestream box.
       [>>] If you have used the `codestream_threshold' feature of the
            `write_headers' function you may need to invoke it again
            periodically, so as to interleave codestream header boxes and/or
            compositing layer header boxes with the codestreams (or
            fragment tables) themselves.
       [>>] Optionally write additional boxes after generating each
            codestream.
       [>>] Call `close' to finish the JPX file (it may or may not write
            additional boxes) and clean up internal resources.
       [>>] Call `jp2_family_tgt::close' when you are completely finished.
       [//]
       Note that this object will make every effort to produce JPX files
       which are also JP2 compatible, recording the outcome of the
       relevant compatibility tests in the file-type box.  For this reason,
       an application may choose to always write JPX files, even if the
       JP2 feature set is sufficient for its purposes.

      write_headers(int *i_param=NULL, void **addr_param=NULL,
                    int codestream_threshold=-1);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Call this function once all codestreams, compositing layers
           and composition instructions have been added, and sufficiently
           initialized.  The function scans the various parameters to be
           written into JPX boxes, reorganizing the information if possible,
           so as to try to ensure that the generated file is JPX compatible
           and maximize the likelihood that it can also be JP2 compatible.
           [//]
           All of the fixed-position headers are then written, including
           the JP2 signature box, the file-type box, the reader requirements
           box and the JP2 header box.
           [//]
           If `codestream_threshold' < 0, all codestream header boxes
           and compositing layer header boxes will also be written at this
           point.  Otherwise, the function writes all codestream header
           boxes, up to and including the one corresponding to
           the codestream whose index is `codestream_threshold' (indices
           run from 0), and all compositing layer header boxes, up to
           and including the first one whose compositing layer uses the
           codestream whose index is `codestream_threshold'.
           [//]
           When used in this way, the function returns with a NULL
           pointer, once it has written this limited set of headers, leaving
           the application to call the function again, with a larger value of
           `codestream_threshold', once it is prepared to write later
           codestreams.  In this way, compositing layer and codestream
           header boxes may be interleaved with the contiguous codestream
           or fragment table codestream boxes.
           [//]
           If you have installed a breakpoint using one of the functions
           `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint', the present function will
           return prematurely, with a pointer to the open super-box
           (either a Codestream Header (chdr) box, or a Compositing Layer
           Header (jplh) box) associated with the context in which the
           breakpoint was installed.  In this case, the function must be
           called again, until all breakpoints have been passed.
         [RETURNS]
           NULL if the requested headers have been completely written.
           This does not necessarily mean that the function need not be
           called again.  Indeed, it may need to be called again if the
           number of codestreams to be written is greater than
           `codestream_threshold'+1.  As explained above, this allows
           codestream header boxes and compositing layer header boxes to
           be interleaved with the codestream data itself, or with
           fragment tables pointing to that data.
           [//]
           A non-NULL return means that a breakpoint has been encountered,
           which usually means that the application should write some custom
           box as a sub-box of the open returned super-box, before invoking
           `write_headers' again.
         [ARG: i_param]
           If non-NULL, the integer parameter passed as an argument to the
           relevant `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint' function is returned in
           *`i_param'.
         [ARG: addr_param]
           If non-NULL, the address parameter passed as an argument to the
           relevant `jpx_codestream_target::set_breakpoint' or
           `jpx_layer_target::set_breakpoint' function is returned in

           Use this function to write the metadata managed via
           `jpx_meta_manager' (see `access_meta_manager') to the actual
           output file.  You must not do this until after `write_headers'
           has been successfully completed, but you can otherwise choose
           to write metadata at any point in the file you like.  Some
           applications may choose to write the metadata prior to
           embedded code-streams, while others might choose to write it all
           at the end of the file.  The latter is probably a better choice
           from the perspective of editing flexibility.
           [//]
           The function may need to be called multiple times before the
           metadata is completely written.  Exactly like `write_headers'
           the function will return with a non-NULL pointer whenever it
           encounters a breakpoint.  A breakpoint is any `jpx_metanode'
           which was created using `jpx_metanode::add_delayed'.
           [//]
           You should not attempt to add any new metadata after the first
           call to this function.
         [RETURNS]
           NULL if all of the available metadata has been written.
           Otherwise, the function has encountered a `jpx_metadata'
           node which was created using `jpx_metanode::add_delayed'.
           In this case, the function returns a pointer to an open
           `jpx_output_box' object which has the correct box type code --
           the one passed to `jpx_metanode::add_delayed'.  You have only
           to write the box's contents.
           [//]
           Note carefully that the function may return the same breakpoint
           twice, expecting you to write the relevant delayed metadata on
           two separate occasions, so you should be careful not to delete any
           state information associated with the `i_param' and `addr_param'
           values.  The reason for this is that a first pass through the
           metadata tree may be required in order to discover the lengths
           and locations of boxes which are the targets of link nodes (these
           are written using cross-reference boxes which identify the absolute
           file location and content length of the referenced boxes).
