class kdu_tiffdir {
  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       This object provides a simple means to interact with TIFF (Tagged Image
       File Format).  The object allows reading, writing and editing of TIFF
       files.
       [//]
       The object ultimately reads from the generic `kdu_compressed_source'
       interface and writes to the generic `kdu_compressed_target'
       interface.  This allows for simple file I/O, memory-based I/O, or
       I/O based on JP2 boxes, for example.  In particular, this provides a
       simple means for reading/writing TIFF files which are themselves
       embedded in JP2 boxes.  This can be useful for a variety of purposes.
       [//]
       To open an existing TIFF file, use the `opendir' function.  You
       may subsequently read tags from the open TIFF directory, but you
       may also create new tags, delete tags or overwrite existing tags.
       [//]
       To create a new TIFF file, use the `init' function.  You may
       subsequently create tags (optionally deleting tags you have created).
       [//]
       Regardless of whether you started with a call to `opendir' or
       `init', you may always write the current state of the TIFF
       directory structure using the `writedir' function.  To write a
       complete TIFF file, you will need to use `write_header' and `writedir',
       but you will also need to write the actual image data.  You may
       choose to write the TIFF directory structure either before or
       after the image data, but you will need to be sure to pass the
       correct `dir_offset' to `writedir' and `write_header'.  You are
       responsible for writing the image data yourself, and you will
       need to include tags (i.e., `KDU_TIFFTAG_StripByteCounts' and
       `KDU_TIFFTAG_StripOffsets' tags) to identify the corresponding strip
       offset/length values -- this means that you will need to know a little
       bit (but not too much) about the TIFF file format yourself.  It would
       be quite easy to extend this class to make these operations transparent
       to the application, but only at the cost of some flexibility in the
       way the file gets generated.
       [//]
       TIFF tags are identified here via 32-bit integers which record both
       the 16-bit tag (most significant 16 bits) and the 16-bit type code
       (least significant 16 bits).  Together, we refer to these quantities
       as a `tag_type'.  The following type codes are recognized:
       [>>] 1 = `kdu_byte'
       [>>] 2 = "ascii" -- char string (null terminator included in length)
       [>>] 3 = `kdu_uint16'
       [>>] 4 = `kdu_uint32'
       [>>] 5 = "rational" -- 2 x `kdu_uint32'; numerator -> denominator
       [>>] 6 = "signed-char"
       [>>] 7 = "undefined" -- opaque array of bytes
       [>>] 8 = `kdu_int16'
       [>>] 9 = `kdu_int32'
       [>>] 10 = "rational" -- 2 x `kdu_int32'; numerator -> denominator
       [>>] 11 = float
       [>>] 12 = double
       [>>] 16 = 64-bit unsigned (represented with `kdu_long')
       [>>] 17 = 64-bit signed (represented with `kdu_long')

             any existing contents -- the function implicitly calls `close'
             first.
           [ARG: littlendian]
             If true, the byte order for the new TIFF directory is
             little-endian (i.e., low order bytes come before
             high order bytes in multi-byte numeric quantities).  Otherwise,
             the byte order is big-endian.
             [//]
             If you are unsure what the native byte order on your machine is,
             you can call the `is_native_littlendian' member function.
             Note, however, that the `read_tag' and `write_tag' functions
             automatically perform all required byte order conversions.
           [ARG: bigtiff]
             If true, the file will be written using the BigTIFF format, which
             has a 16-byte header (instead of 8 bytes), 20-byte tags
             (instead of 12 bytes), a slightly different directory
             header/trailer, and allows 64-bit integer data types to be used
             for StripOffsets, StripByteCounts, TileOffsets and TileByteCounts.

        /* [SYNOPSIS]
             Use this function to open an existing TIFF file, reading its
             directory contents.  The function records only the directory
             entries permanently in memory.  To access TIFF tags from
             this directory, use the `open_tag' or one of the `read_tag'
             functions.  You may edit the open directory by using the
             `delete_tag', `create_tag' or `write_tag' functions.
             [//]
             The function implicitly invokes `close' first, so as to

             at the start of the TIFF header within the stream.  The
             internal implementation first recovers the current source
             position by invoking `src->get_pos' -- this is addded as an
             offset to all offsets specified in the TIFF structure.
           [RETURNS]
             False if a valid TIFF header could not be found, or if
             `src' does not support seeking, in which case
             the object remains in the closed state (`exists' returns false).

             write the TIFF directory either or before or after the
             imagery, but writing it before the imagery implies that
             you must have been able to determine the strip offsets
             and lengths associated with the imagery, since these
             are part of the TIFF structure which gets written

             the location at which the directory is being written,
             relative to the start of the TIFF file, as communicated by
             the `dir_offset' argument.

             This function accomplishes two roles: 1) it searches for a tag
             of interest, returning 0 if it cannot be found, or else the
             tag-type code; and 2) it resets the internal "read pointer"

             will start again from the beginning of the tag's contents.
             In most cases, you don't actually need to call this function,
             since the `read_tag' functions automatically start reading
             from the start of the tag if it has not previously been read.
