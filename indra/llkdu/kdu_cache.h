  /* [BIND: reference]
     [SYNOPSIS]
       Implements a caching compressed data source, i.e., one which offers
       the `KDU_SOURCE_CAP_CACHED' capability explained in connection with
       `kdu_compressed_source::get_capabilities'.
       [//]
       The object has two types of interfaces: those used to transfer new
       data into the cache (e.g., data received incrementally over a
       network connection); and those used to retrieve the cached data.  By
       implementing the `acquire_lock' and `release_lock' functions in
       a derived class, these two sets of functions may be safely invoked
       from different threads in a multi-threading environment, allowing
       cache updates to occur asynchronously with cached data access.
       [//]
       When a caching data source is supplied to `kdu_codestream::create'
       the image quality obtained when rendering the code-stream data
       generally improves as more and more compressed data is transferred
       into the cache using the `add_to_databin' function.  Note carefully
       that the object must not be passed into `kdu_codestream::create'
       at least until the main header data-bin has been completed.  This
       may be verified by calling `get_databin_length', with a
       data-bin class of `KDU_MAIN_HEADER_DATABIN'.  Before passing the
       object to `kdu_codestream::create' you must call `set_read_scope',
       passing in these same data-bin class and in-class identifiers
       (`KDU_MAIN_HEADER_DATABIN' and 0, respectively).
       [//]
       Even more functionality may be achieved if you read from a caching
       data source indirectly via a `jp2_source' object.  To do this, you
       must first create and open a `jp2_family_src' object, passing the
       `kdu_cache' object in as the `jp2_family_src' object's data source.
       You can then open JP2 boxes by passing the `jp2_family_src' object
       in the call to `jp2_input_box::open' or to `jp2_source::open'.  In
       fact, you may open multiple boxes simultaneously on the same
       `jp2_family_src' object (even from multiple threads, if you are
       careful to implement the synchronization objects offered by the
       `jp2_family_src' class.  Using the `kdu_cache' object as a source
       for JP2 box and JP2 source reading, provides you with additional
       functionality specifically designed for interacting with the meta-data
       and with multiple code-streams via the JPIP protocol and allows high
       level applications to be largely oblivious as to whether the ultimate
       source of information is local or remote.
       [//]
       Some effort is invested in the implementation of this object to
       ensure that truly massive compressed images (many Gigabytes in size)
       may be cached efficiently.  In particular, both header data and
       compressed precinct data are managed using a special sparse cache
       structure, which supports both efficient random access and dynamic
       growth.
       [//]
       The present object maintains its own LRU (Least Recently Used) lists
       which can be used to implement cache management policies when clients
       have insufficient memory to buffer compressed data indefinitely.  The
       LRU list may be traversed in either direction (most to least recently
       used data-bins, or vice-versa).  Elements may also be promoted or
       demoted within the list by making appropriate function calls.

      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           This function may be called to attach the cache object to another
           existing cache object.  Once attached, all attempts to access
           the contents of the cache will actually access the contents of
           the `existing' cache.  While attached, you may not use the
           `add_to_databin' function or any member function which modifies
           the cache contents, or their auxiliary information (list order
           and mark status), since the object has no cache elements
           of its  own.  In this mode, the `existing' object's `acquire_lock'
           and `release_lock' function will be used instead of the present
           object's synchronization functions, wherever synchronization is
           required.
           [//]
           To detach the cache, you must call `close', after which the
           object will be able to perform as an autonomous cache.

           using the object again with a clean slate.  Immediately after
           this call, the `get_databin_length' function will return 0 in

                     int offset, int num_bytes, bool is_final,
                     bool add_as_most_recent=true,
                     bool mark_if_augmented=false);
      /* [SYNOPSIS]
           Augments the cached representation of the indicated data-bin.  The
           data-bin is identified by a class code, `databin_class', a
           code-stream ID (normally 0, unless the cache is used to manage
           multiple code-streams simultaneously) and an in-class identifier,
           `databin_id'.  Currently, the classes defined by this
           object are `KDU_META_DATABIN', `KDU_MAIN_HEADER_DATABIN',
           `KDU_TILE_HEADER_DATABIN', `KDU_PRECINCT_DATABIN' and
           `KDU_TILE_DATABIN'.
           [>>] The `KDU_META_DATABIN' class is used with JP2-family file
                formats to communicate metadata and file structure
                information.  Amongst other things, this metadata provides
                the framework within which the content of code-stream
                specific data-bins are to be interpreted.  For this data-bin
                class, the value of the `codestream_id' is ignored.  Raw
                code-streams have exactly one metadata-bin (the one with
                `databin_id'=0) which must be empty -- it must be signalled
                as finalized after transferring 0 bytes of content data.
           [>>] For the `KDU_MAIN_HEADER_DATABIN' class, the in-class
                identifier must be equal to 0, while the code-stream
                identifier indicates the code-stream whose main header is
                being augmented.
           [>>] For the `KDU_TILE_HEADER_DATABIN' class, the in-class
                identifier (`databin_id') holds the tile number, starting
                from 0 for the tile in the upper left hand corner of the
                image.
           [>>] For the `KDU_PRECINCT_DATABIN' class, the in-class identifier
                has the interpretation described in connection with
                `kdu_compressed_source::set_precinct_scope'.
           [>>] For the `KDU_TILE_DATABIN' class, the in-class identifier has
                the same interpretation as for `KDU_TILE_HEADER_DATABIN'.
                Generally, an interactive communication involves either the
                `KDU_TILE_HEADER_DATABIN' and `KDU_PRECINCT_DATABIN' classes,
                or the `KDU_TILE_DATABIN' class, but not both.
           [//]
           New data may be added to the cache in any desired order, which is
           why the absolute location (`offset') and length (`num_bytes') of
           the new data are explicitly specified in the call.  If the new
           data range overlaps with data which already exists in the cache,
           the present function may either overwrite or leave the overlapping
           data bytes as they were.  Both interpretations are assumed to
           produce the same result, since the nominal contents of any
           given data-bin are not permitted to change over time.
         [ARG: is_final]
           If true, the cache is being informed that the supplied bytes
           represent the terminal portion of the data-bin.  If there are no
           holes, the cache representation is complete.  If there are holes,
           the cache representation of the data-bin will be complete once
           these holes have been filled in.  At that time, the
           `get_databin_length' function will set an `is_complete' argument
           to true.
         [ARG: add_as_most_recent]
           If true, the data-bin to which data is added is automatically
           promoted to the head of the "most recently used" list.  Otherwise,
           the data-bin's current position in the list is not affected.  If
           a new data-bin entry needs to be created in the cache and the
           `add_as_most_recent' argument is false, the new entry is placed
           at the tail of the "most recently used" list, not its head.
         [ARG: mark_if_augmented]
           If true, the data-bin's marking flag will be set (future calls to
           `mark_databin' will return true) if and only if the present
           call augments the cached contents of the indicated data-bin.  This
           is useful when adding data obtained from a cache file generated
           during a previous browsing session.  The marked state can then
           be used to keep track of data-bins whose state is not fully known
           by a server.

           It is not safe to call this function while any calls to the
           codestream management machinery accessed via `kdu_codestream'
           are in progress, since they may try to read from the caching data
           source themselves.  For this reason, you will usually want to
           invoke this function from the same thread of execution as that
           used to access the code-stream and perform decompression tasks.
           Use of this function from within a `jp2_input_box' or `jp2_source'
           object is safe, even in multi-threaded applications (so long as
           the synchronization members of `kdu_family_src' are implemented
           by the application).
           [//]
           Before passing a `kdu_cache' object directly to
           `kdu_codestream::create', you should first use the present function
           to set the read-scope to `databin_class'=`KDU_MAIN_HEADER_DATABIN'
           and `databin_id'=0.

           This function implements the functionality required of

           the data-bin indicated in the most recent call to
           `set_read_scope' -- note that `set_read_scope' may have been
           invoked indirectly from `set_tileheader_scope' or
           `set_precinct_sope'.  If `set_read_scope' has not yet been called,

           The number of bytes actually read and written into the supplied
           `buf' buffer.  This value will never exceed `num_bytes', but may
           be less than `num_bytes' if the end of the data-bin is encountered.
