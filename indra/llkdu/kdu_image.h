             way to remove any previously declared knowledge of the colour
             representation.

           available (i.e., `set_forced_precision' has not been called).
           Otherwise, it returns the forced precision associated with the

           a forced precision has been set, if required.  Note that a value
           of 0 means do nothing; such a value may have been explicitly set
           in a call to `set_forced_precision'.
           [//]
           If an image file reader supports precision forcing, it should
           interpret a non-zero value returned by this function as the
           bit-depth of the sample values which should be supplied in
           response to a call to `kdu_image_in::get'.  When the image
           reader is initialized, it may use the value returned by
           `get_bit_depth' if required, to determine the precision of the
           data samples recorded in the file (this is only needed for raw
           files).  However, it should explicitly change this value
           (via `set_bit_depth') to the forced precision.  The `align_lsbs'
           value identifies two possible precision forcing modes as follows:
           [>>] If `align_lsbs' is true, the sample values read from the
                image file are forced to fit into the identified precision
                without any scaling.  This means that a value of 1 in the
                original file will remain 1 after precision forcing.  Values
                which exceed the range which can be represented by the
                forced precision should be clipped -- as opposed to just
                ignoring the most significant bits.
           [>>] If `align_lsbs' is false, the sample values read from the
                image file are scaled by a power of 2, such that the
                most significant bit in the original representation corresponds
                to the most significant bit in the representation produced
                by precision forcing.  If this involves the synthesis of
                additional LSB's, they should be set to 0; if it involves the
                elimination of original LSB's, rounding to the nearest
                representable value should be employed.
           [//]
           If an image file writer supports precision forcing, it should
           interpret a non-zero value returned by this function as the
           bit-depth of the samples to be recorded in the output file.
           In this case, the value returned by `get_bit_depth' represents
           the actual precision of the data supplied via the
           `kdu_image_out::put' function.  Again, the behaviour of the file
           writer depends upon the `align_lsbs' value, as follows:
           [>>] If `align_lsbs' is true, the sample values written to the
                output file are not scaled, meaning that a value of 1 (with
                respect to the `get_bit_depth' precision) should be written
                as a 1 (with respect to the forced precision used in the
                output file).  If the `get_bit_depth' value is larger than
                the forced precision, some values may need to be clipped to
                the range which can be accommodated by the `forced_precision'.
           [>>] If `align_lsbs' is false, the sample values written to the
                output file are scaled, so that the most significant bit of
                the representation used to supply data via
                `kdu_image_out::put' is aligned with the most significant bit
                of the forced precision used to actually write the data.
                Such scaling is always by a power of 2; rounding to the
                nearest representable value should be employed if LSB's are
                discarded during the shifting process.

     equal to 0.0.
        The remaining parameters do not strictly relate to image dimensions,
     but they represent a convenient way to communicate any additional
     known attributes between image file I/O functions and the compressed

     Support for reading a wide range of image file formats is NOT a

     file formats, we realize that most application developers will prefer

     interacting with image files -- some applications might not need to

     This class provides a uniform interface to any number of image readers,

     are selected and created by the constructor and destroyed using the
     explicit `destroy' function.  The `kdu_image_in' object itself contains
     only a pointer to the internal reader object.  Copying a `kdu_image_in'
     object has no impact on the internal image reader, but simply serves to
     provide another interface to it.
     [//]
     An individual image file may provide one or more image components.
     When multiple components are available, each component may be accessed
     independently, reading lines one by one.  The object manages any
     buffering required to cater for applications which read the components
     at different rates, although this is not recommended.  It is also
     possible to access image component lines in disjoint segments, known
     as tile-lines.  This capability is provided to assist tile-based

           file reading object, based on the file suffix or some other
           property (e.g., a magic number found at the start of the file).
           The method used to ascertain the file format and the set of
           file formats which are supported is entirely dependent
           on the implementation.
           [//]
           Component indices for the image components represented by the
           file start from the value supplied via the `next_comp_idx'
           argument.  These component indices are used to access
           dimensional and other parameters for the `dims' object.  Upon
           return, the `next_comp_idx' is updated to include the
           image components contributed by this file.
           [//]
           The `dims' object provides the central mechanism for exchanging
           information about component dimensions.  For raw files, the
           component dimension and precision information is recovered from
           this object in order to discover the structure of the file, using
           `dims.append_components' as required to replicate the information
           available for previous components.  If insufficient information
           can be retrieved in this fashion (i.e., this only happens if
           `dims' was empty on entry), the function generates an appropriate
           error.
           [//]
           For non-raw files, information in the image file header is used
           to configure the relevant component dimensions and precision
           information in the `dims' object.
         [ARG: fname]
           Relative path name of the image file to be opened.
         [ARG: dims]
           Object through which image component dimensions, bit-depth and
           signed/unsigned characteristics are exchanged with the
           application, along with any display resolution information
           which might be available.
         [ARG: next_comp_idx]
           Identifies the component index assigned to the first image
           component (starting from 0) in the file.  Upon return, the
           value of this argument is augmented by the number of image
           components available from the file.  Once all image files have
           been opened, the value of `next_comp_idx' (assuming it was
           initially 0) will hold the total number of image components.
         [ARG: vflip]
           This argument is provided to support bottom-up image file
           formats, such as the well-known BMP format. The value of `vflip'
           is set to true if the image lines are going to be supplied in
           bottom-up fashion, allowing the compressor to configure itself
           for processing the data in reverse order (see
           `kdu_codestream::change_appearance' for more on this).
         [ARG: palette]
           May be non-NULL if the JPEG2000 compressed file format supports
           signalling of colour palette information (JP2 files provide such
           support).  BMP and TIFF files, for example, may contain palettized
           data.  In this case, the `palette' object's entries are filled out
           to reflect the index of the image component to which the palette is
           applied, along with the palette itself.  Palettes which require
           more than 8-bit indices should be expanded directly by the file
           reader.  If the `palette.input_bits' is set to a non-zero
           value already, the palette is in use and a new palette cannot be
           created for the present image file.  In this case, or if the
           `palette' argument is NULL, the image sample values are to be
           depalettized by the image reader, which will normally provide
           a full set of colour channels.
         [ARG: skip_bytes]
           Number of initial bytes from the file to be ignored.
         [ARG: quiet]
           Suppresses reporting of special image features which might
           be encountered.

           [>>] It can happen that some tiles have no samples whatsoever.
                For safety, these tiles should still be read from the `get'
                function.
           [//]
           Sample values in the `line' buffer are always signed quantities.
           For normalized (floating or fixed point) sample values, the nominal
           range is from -0.5 to 0.5, while for absolute integer values, the
           range is from -2^{B-1} to 2^{B-1}, where B is the bit-depth.  The

  /* [SYNOPSIS]
     Support for writing a wide range of image file formats is NOT a
     significant objective for the Kakadu tools.  Although the
     present object is easily extended to work with any number of different
     file formats, we realize that most application developers will prefer
     to use their own (probably much more sophisticated) tools for
     interacting with image files -- some applications might not need to
     work with uncompressed image files at all.
     [//]
     This class provides a uniform interface to any number of image writers,
     supporting different image file formats.  Specific file format writers
     are selected and created by the constructor (based on the file name
     suffix) and destroyed using the explicit `destroy' function.  The
     `kdu_image_out' object itself contains only a pointer to the internal
     writer object.  Copying a `kdu_image_out' object has no impact on the
     internal image writer, but simply serves to provide another interface
     to it.
     [//]
     An individual image file may store one or more image components.
     When multiple components are stored, each component may be accessed
     independently, writing lines one by one.  The object manages any
     buffering required to cater for applications which write the components
     at different rates, although this is not recommended.  It is also
     possible to write image component lines in disjoint segments, known
     as tile-lines.  This capability is provided to assist in efficient
     decompression of tiled compressed imagery.

           Component indices for the image components represented by the
           file start from the value supplied via the `next_comp_idx'

           bit-depths and signed/unsigned characteristics are all deduced
           from the `dims' argument.  This object may also be used to
           recover resolution information which may potentially be
           available.  Note the difference between the methods used to pass
           dimensions to/from the `kdu_image_in' object and the
           `kdu_image_out' object.  The former needs to take advantage of
           the rich capabilities offered by the `siz_params' class to
           extrapolated limited information which may be present concerning
           dimensions (e.g., for raw files), while the present object is not
           constructed until all dimensional information is already available
           from a JPEG2000 code-stream.

           Also, when compressing image data, all original image components
           must be available from files, while decompressors may choose to
           decompress only a limited set of image components, or may need to
           map components through expansive palettes, introducing fundamental
           differences between the information represented by the code-stream
           SIZ marker segment and the dimensions of generated image files.

           value of this argument is augmented by the number of image
           components available from the file.

           This argument is provided to support bottom-up image file
           formats, such as the well-known BMP format. The value of `vflip'
           is set to true if the image lines must be supplied in

           efficiently, see `kdu_codestream::change_appearance'.
